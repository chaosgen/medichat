what are the genetic changes related to mabry syndrome ?,"mutations in the pigv, pigo, or pgap2 gene cause mabry syndrome. these genes are all involved in the production (synthesis) of a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor. this molecule is synthesized in a series of steps. it then attaches (binds) to various proteins and binds them to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that they are available when needed. alkaline phosphatase is an example of a protein that is bound to the cell membrane by a gpi anchor.  the proteins produced from the pigv and pigo genes are involved in piecing together the gpi anchor. after the complete gpi anchor is attached to a protein, the protein produced from the pgap2 gene adjusts the anchor to enhance the anchor's ability to bind to the cell membrane.  mutations in the pigv, pigo, or pgap2 gene result in the production of an incomplete gpi anchor that cannot attach to proteins or to cell membranes. proteins lacking a functional gpi anchor cannot bind to the cell membrane and are instead released from the cell. the release of non-gpi anchored alkaline phosphatase elevates the amount of this protein in the blood, causing hyperphosphatasia in people with mabry syndrome. it is unclear how gene mutations lead to the other features of mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper gpi anchoring of proteins.  pigv gene mutations are the most frequent cause of mabry syndrome, accounting for approximately half of all cases. mutations in the pigo and pgap2 genes are responsible for a small proportion of mabry syndrome. the remaining affected individuals do not have an identified mutation in any of these three genes; the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."
what is (are) fibromuscular dysplasia ?,"fibromuscular dysplasia (fmd) is the abnormal development or growth of cells in the walls of arteries that can cause the vessels to narrow or bulge. the carotid arteries, which pass through the neck and supply blood to the brain, are commonly affected. arteries within the brain and kidneys can also be affected. narrowing and enlarging of arteries can block or reduce blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. some patients experience no symptoms of the disease while others may have high blood pressure, dizziness or vertigo, chronic headache, intracranial aneurysm, ringing in the ears, weakness or numbness in the face, neck pain, or changes in vision. fmd is most often seen in people age 25 to 50 years and affects women more often than men. more than one family member may be affected by the disease. the cause of fmd is unknown. treatment is based on the arteries affected and the progression and severity of the disease."

what is (are) donnai-barrow syndrome ?,"donnai-barrow syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects many parts of the body. this disorder is characterized by unusual facial features, including prominent, wide-set eyes with outer corners that point downward; a short bulbous nose with a flat nasal bridge; ears that are rotated backward; and a widow's peak hairline.  individuals with donnai-barrow syndrome have severe hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). in addition, they often experience vision problems, including extreme nearsightedness (high myopia), detachment or deterioration of the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye (the retina), and progressive vision loss. some have a gap or split in the colored part of the eye (iris coloboma).  in almost all people with donnai-barrow syndrome, the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is underdeveloped or absent. affected individuals may also have other structural abnormalities of the brain. they generally have mild to moderate intellectual disability and developmental delay.  people with donnai-barrow syndrome may also have a hole in the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm), which is called a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. this potentially serious birth defect allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest and possibly crowd the developing heart and lungs. an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the navel may also occur in affected individuals. occasionally people with donnai-barrow syndrome have abnormalities of the intestine, heart, or other organs."
is vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited ?,"best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.  the inheritance pattern of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is uncertain. some studies have suggested that this disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. it is difficult to be sure, however, because many affected people have no history of the disorder in their family, and only a small number of affected families have been reported."
how to diagnose cohen syndrome ?,"how is cohen syndrome diagnosed? the diagnosis of cohen syndrome is based on the symptoms present in the patient, but because the symptoms vary greatly from person to person, no consensus diagnostic criteria exist. genetic testing is available for coh1, the only gene known to be associated with cohen syndrome. however, the rate at which mutations are detected via genetic testing varies by ethnicity. for example, the mutation detection rate in coh1 is higher among the finnish and old amish compared to individuals of from other populations."

what is (are) robinow syndrome ?,"robinow syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the bones as well as other parts of the body. two forms of robinow syndrome have been described: autosomal recessive robinow syndrome, and the milder autosomal dominant robinow syndrome. they are distinguished based on their modes of inheritance, symptoms, and severity. autosomal recessive robinow syndrome causes shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs; short fingers and toes; wedge-shaped spinal bones leading to kyphoscoliosis; fused or missing ribs; short stature; and distinctive facial features. other features may include underdeveloped genitalia; dental problems; kidney or heart defects; or delayed development. this form is caused by mutations in the ror2 gene. autosomal dominant robinow syndrome causes more mild, but similar, features. there are rarely spine and rib abnormalities, and short stature is less severe. a variant type of this form is additionally characterized by osteosclerosis. autosomal dominant robinow syndrome may be caused by a mutation in the wnt5a or dvl1 gene. in some cases, the underlying cause of robinow syndrome is unknown. management may include bracing or surgery for skeletal abnormalities and growth hormone to increase growth rate in affected children."
what is (are) bipolar disorder ?,"bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. people who have it go through unusual mood changes. they go from very happy, ""up,"" and active to very sad and hopeless, ""down,"" and inactive, and then back again. they often have normal moods in between. the up feeling is called mania. the down feeling is depression.    the causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. it runs in families. abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role.    bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. but children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. the illness usually lasts a lifetime.    if you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. a medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.    if not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. however, there are effective treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. a combination usually works best.    nih: national institute of mental health"
what are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome ?,"how might chronic fatigue syndrome be treated? treatment options for chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) are limited.[9440] treatment is largely supportive and is focused on the specific symptoms present in each individual. in most cases, symptoms of cfs lessen over time. many therapies have been tried, but only cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) and graded exercise therapy reportedly appear to produce meaningful benefit. cbt typically involves a series of one-hour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that might delay recovery. graded exercise therapy can be beneficial because prolonged lack of exercise may worsen the symptoms of the condition and should be discouraged.[9440] gradual introduction of regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging, under close medical supervision may reduce fatigue and improve physical function. the goal is to have 30 minutes of light exercise five times a week. to avoid overexertion it is recommended to set a target heart rate range, generally <100 beats per minute. graded exercise should be always supervised by a physical therapist or exercise therapist. in some studies, women with this condition were found to have low normal fitness on treadmill testing with no indication of heart or lung problems. maximal testing did not result in worse fatigue or other symptoms. because many people who have cfs are also depressed, treating the depression can make it easier to cope with the problems associated with cfs. low doses of some antidepressants may help improve sleep and relieve pain.[6269] a number of medications, special diets and vitamin supplements have been evaluated in individuals with cfs, but none have been proven effective. although there have been a number of viruses that were initially reported to cause cfs, additional studies have not proven this.[9440] trials of antiviral agents have been ineffective in relieving the symptoms of cfs. several clinical trials aiming to find effective treatment are currently ongoing."
what is (are) hereditary fructose intolerance ?,"hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi) is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an enzyme called aldolase b. in people with hfi, ingestion of fructose (fruit sugar) and sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar) causes severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and the build up of dangerous substances in the liver. hfi may be relatively mild or a very severe disease. the condition is caused by mutations in the aldob gene. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. treatment involves eliminating fructose and sucrose from the diet. in the severe form, eliminating these sugars from the diet may not prevent progressive liver disease."

how many people are affected by giant congenital melanocytic nevus ?,"giant congenital melanocytic nevus occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 newborns worldwide."
what are the genetic changes related to sotos syndrome ?,"mutations in the nsd1 gene are the primary cause of sotos syndrome, accounting for up to 90 percent of cases. other genetic causes of this condition have not been identified.  the nsd1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase. histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify structural proteins called histones, which attach (bind) to dna and give chromosomes their shape. by adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases regulate the activity of certain genes and can turn them on and off as needed. the nsd1 protein controls the activity of genes involved in normal growth and development, although most of these genes have not been identified.  genetic changes involving the nsd1 gene prevent one copy of the gene from producing any functional protein. research suggests that a reduced amount of nsd1 protein disrupts the normal activity of genes involved in growth and development. however, it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of this protein during development leads to overgrowth, learning disabilities, and the other features of sotos syndrome."
what is (are) myhre syndrome ?,"myhre syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, unusual facial features, and various bone (skeletal) abnormalities. other findings may include hearing impairment, abnormal enlargement of the muscles (muscle hypertrophy), and/or joint stiffness. myhre syndrome is caused by mutations in the smad4 gene. this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. most cases are due to a new mutation."
what are the treatments for henoch-schonlein purpura ?,"what treatments are available for henoch-schonlein purpura? unfortunately, there is no cure for henoch-schonlein purpura (hsp).  treatments aim to relieve the symptoms of this condition.  for example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be used to relieve pain.  if the kidneys are severely affected in an individual with hsp, immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclophosphamide, may be prescribed.  in rare cases, individuals with hsp may need to be hospitalized if they experience severe abdominal pain, bleeding from the digestive tract, or kidney problems."
how to diagnose copd ?,"to confirm a copd diagnosis, a doctor will use a breathing test called spirometry. the test is easy and painless. it shows how well the lungs are working. the spirometer measures how much air the lungs can hold and how fast air is blown out of the lungs. other tests, such as bronchodilator reversibility testing, a chest x-ray, and arterial blood gas test, may be ordered."

what are the genetic changes related to melnick-needles syndrome ?,"mutations in the flna gene cause melnick-needles syndrome.  the flna gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin a, which helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin a binds to another protein called actin, and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. filamin a also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell.  a small number of mutations in the flna gene have been identified in people with melnick-needles syndrome. these mutations are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin a protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. researchers believe that the mutations may change the way the filamin a protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of melnick-needles syndrome."
is norrie disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. she can pass on the gene, but generally does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. in rare cases, however, carrier females have shown some retinal abnormalities or mild hearing loss associated with norrie disease."
what are the symptoms of pulmonary venous return anomaly ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of pulmonary venous return anomaly? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for pulmonary venous return anomaly. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the cardiac septa 90% anomalous pulmonary venous return 90% respiratory insufficiency 7.5% tapered distal phalanges of finger 5% aplasia/hypoplasia of the nails - autosomal dominant inheritance - pulmonary hypertension - recurrent respiratory infections - total anomalous pulmonary venous return - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) laron syndrome ?,laron syndrome is a condition that occurs when the body is unable to utilize growth hormone. it is primarily characterized by short stature. other signs and symptoms vary but may include reduced muscle strength and endurance; hypoglycemia in infancy; delayed puberty; short limbs (arms and legs); and obesity. it is often caused by changes (mutations) in the ghr gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is focused on improving growth and generally includes injections of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1).
how to prevent glaucoma ?,"at this time, we do not know how to prevent glaucoma. however, studies have shown that the early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control the disease. so, if you fall into one of the higher risk groups for the disease, make sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every one to two years.  get tips on finding an eye care professional. learn what a comprehensive dilated eye exam involves."
what is (are) triple x syndrome ?,"triple x syndrome, also called trisomy x or 47,xxx, is characterized by the presence of an additional x chromosome in each of a female's cells. although females with this condition may be taller than average, this chromosomal change typically causes no unusual physical features. most females with triple x syndrome have normal sexual development and are able to conceive children.  triple x syndrome is associated with an increased risk of learning disabilities and delayed development of speech and language skills. delayed development of motor skills (such as sitting and walking), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and behavioral and emotional difficulties are also possible, but these characteristics vary widely among affected girls and women. seizures or kidney abnormalities occur in about 10 percent of affected females."
what is (are) hereditary xanthinuria ?,"hereditary xanthinuria is a condition that most often affects the kidneys. it is characterized by high levels of a compound called xanthine and very low levels of another compound called uric acid in the blood and urine. the excess xanthine can accumulate in the kidneys and other tissues. in the kidneys, xanthine forms tiny crystals that occasionally build up to create kidney stones. these stones can impair kidney function and ultimately cause kidney failure. related signs and symptoms can include abdominal pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, and blood in the urine (hematuria). less commonly, xanthine crystals build up in the muscles, causing pain and cramping. in some people with hereditary xanthinuria, the condition does not cause any health problems.  researchers have described two major forms of hereditary xanthinuria, types i and ii. the types are distinguished by the enzymes involved; they have the same signs and symptoms."
is dandy-walker malformation inherited ?,"most cases of dandy-walker malformation are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. a small percentage of cases seem to run in families; however, dandy-walker malformation does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this disorder. first-degree relatives (such as siblings and children) of people with dandy-walker malformation have an increased risk of developing the condition compared with people in the general population.  when dandy-walker malformation is a feature of a genetic condition, it is inherited in the pattern of that condition."
what causes fecal incontinence ?,"fecal incontinence has many causes, including
                
- diarrhea  - constipation  - muscle damage or weakness  - nerve damage  - loss of stretch in the rectum  - childbirth by vaginal delivery  - hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse  - rectocele  - inactivity
                
diarrhea
                
diarrhea can cause fecal incontinence. loose stools fill the rectum quickly and are more difficult to hold than solid stools. diarrhea increases the chance of not reaching a bathroom in time.
                
constipation
                
constipation can lead to large, hard stools that stretch the rectum and cause the internal sphincter muscles to relax by reflex. watery stool builds up behind the hard stool and may leak out around the hard stool, leading to fecal incontinence.
                
the type of constipation that is most likely to lead to fecal incontinence occurs when people are unable to relax their external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles when straining to have a bowel movement, often mistakenly squeezing these muscles instead of relaxing them. this squeezing makes it difficult to pass stool and may lead to a large amount of stool in the rectum. this type of constipation, called dyssynergic defecation or disordered defecation, is a result of faulty learning. for example, children or adults who have pain when having a bowel movement may unconsciously learn to squeeze their muscles to delay the bowel movement and avoid pain.
                
muscle damage or weakness
                
injury to one or both of the sphincter muscles can cause fecal incontinence. if these muscles, called the external and internal anal sphincter muscles, are damaged or weakened, they may not be strong enough to keep the anus closed and prevent stool from leaking.
                
trauma, childbirth injuries, cancer surgery, and hemorrhoid surgery are possible causes of injury to the sphincters. hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum.
                
nerve damage
                
the anal sphincter muscles wont open and close properly if the nerves that control them are damaged. likewise, if the nerves that sense stool in the rectum are damaged, a person may not feel the urge to go to the bathroom. both types of nerve damage can lead to fecal incontinence. possible sources of nerve damage are childbirth; a long-term habit of straining to pass stool; spinal cord injury; and diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, that affect the nerves that go to the sphincter muscles and rectum. brain injuries from stroke, head trauma, or certain diseases can also cause fecal incontinence.
                
loss of stretch in the rectum
                
normally, the rectum stretches to hold stool until a person has a bowel movement. rectal surgery, radiation treatment, and inflammatory bowel diseaseschronic disorders that cause irritation and sores on the lining of the digestive systemcan cause the rectal walls to become stiff. the rectum then cant stretch as much to hold stool, increasing the risk of fecal incontinence.
                
childbirth by vaginal delivery
                
childbirth sometimes causes injuries to muscles and nerves in the pelvic floor. the risk is greater if forceps are used to help deliver the baby or if an episiotomya cut in the vaginal area to prevent the babys head from tearing the vagina during birthis performed. fecal incontinence related to childbirth can appear soon after delivery or many years later.
                
hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse
                
external hemorrhoids, which develop under the skin around the anus, can prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing completely. rectal prolapse, a condition that causes the rectum to drop down through the anus, can also prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing well enough to prevent leakage. small amounts of mucus or liquid stool can then leak through the anus.
                
rectocele
                
rectocele is a condition that causes the rectum to protrude through the vagina. rectocele can happen when the thin layer of muscles separating the rectum from the vagina becomes weak. for women with rectocele, straining to have a bowel movement may be less effective because rectocele reduces the amount of downward force through the anus. the result may be retention of stool in the rectum. more research is needed to be sure rectocele increases the risk of fecal incontinence.
                
inactivity
                
people who are inactive, especially those who spend many hours a day sitting or lying down, have an increased risk of retaining a large amount of stool in the rectum. liquid stool can then leak around the more solid stool. frail, older adults are most likely to develop constipation-related fecal incontinence for this reason."
what is (are) multi-infarct dementia ?,"multi-infarct dementia (mid) is a common cause of memory loss in the elderly. mid is caused by multiple strokes (disruption of blood flow to the brain). disruption of blood flow leads to damaged brain tissue. some of these strokes may occur without noticeable clinical symptoms. doctors refer to these as silent strokes. an individual having asilent stroke may not even know it is happening, but over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged and more small blood vessels are blocked, the symptoms of mid begin to appear. mid can be diagnosed by an mri or ct of the brain, along with a neurological examination. symptoms include confusion or problems with short-term memory; wandering, or getting lost in familiar places; walking with rapid, shuffling steps; losing bladder or bowel control; laughing or crying inappropriately; having difficulty following instructions; and having problems counting money and making monetary transactions. mid, which typically begins between the ages of 60 and 75, affects men more often than women. because the symptoms of mid are so similar to alzheimers disease, it can be difficult for a doctor to make a firm diagnosis. since the diseases often occur together, making a single diagnosis of one or the other is even more problematic."
what is (are) factor x deficiency ?,"factor x deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that varies in severity among affected individuals. the signs and symptoms of this condition can begin at any age, although the most severe cases are apparent in childhood. factor x deficiency commonly causes nosebleeds, easy bruising, bleeding under the skin, bleeding of the gums, blood in the urine (hematuria), and prolonged or excessive bleeding following surgery or trauma. women with factor x deficiency can have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) or excessive bleeding in childbirth, and may be at increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage). bleeding into joint spaces (hemarthrosis) occasionally occurs. severely affected individuals have an increased risk of bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage), in the lungs (pulmonary hemorrhage), or in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be life-threatening."
what is (are) y chromosome infertility ?,"y chromosome infertility is a condition that affects the production of sperm, making it difficult or impossible for affected men to father children. an affected man's body may produce no sperm cells (azoospermia), a smaller than usual number of sperm cells (oligospermia), or sperm cells that are abnormally shaped or that do not move properly.  some men with y chromosome infertility who have mild to moderate oligospermia may eventually father a child naturally. assisted reproductive technologies may help other affected men; most men with y chromosome infertility have some sperm cells in the testes that can be extracted for this purpose. the most severely affected men do not have any mature sperm cells in the testes. this form of y chromosome infertility is called sertoli cell-only syndrome.  men with y chromosome infertility usually do not have any other signs or symptoms. occasionally they may have unusually small testes or undescended testes (cryptorchidism)."
who is at risk for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors? ?,having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of an extracranial germ cell tumor. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    possible risk factors for extracranial germ cell tumors include the following:         - having certain genetic syndromes:               -  klinefelter syndrome may increase the risk of germ cell tumors in the mediastinum.      - swyer syndrome may increase the risk of germ cell tumors in the testicles or ovaries.      - turner syndrome may increase the risk of germ cell tumors in the ovaries.             - having an undescended testicle may increase the risk of developing a testicular germ cell tumor.
what is (are) 21-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"21-hydroxylase-deficiency is a genetic disorder of cortisol biosynthesis. it is caused by mutations in the human 21-hydroxylase gene (cyp21a2). symptoms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency vary, but can involve salt-wasting crises in infants; ambiguous genitalia in female infants; excessive hair, deep voice, abnormal periods, no periods, and fertility problems in older girls and women; early development of masculine features in boys; and shorter than average adult height, acne, and blood pressure problems."
what are the genetic changes related to chorea-acanthocytosis ?,"mutations in the vps13a gene cause chorea-acanthocytosis. the vps13a gene provides instructions for producing a protein called chorein; the function of this protein in the body is unknown. some researchers believe that chorein plays a role in the movement of proteins within cells. most vps13a gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of chorein. the vps13a gene is active (expressed) throughout the body; it is unclear why mutations in this gene affect only the brain and red blood cells."
is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy inherited ?,is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (cidp) inherited? cidp is not known to be inherited and is considered an acquired disorder. no clear genetic predisposition or other predisposing factors for cidp have been identified.
what are the genetic changes related to choroideremia ?,"mutations in the chm gene cause choroideremia. the chm gene provides instructions for producing the rab escort protein-1 (rep-1). as an escort protein, rep-1 attaches to molecules called rab proteins within the cell and directs them to the membranes of various cell compartments (organelles). rab proteins are involved in the movement of proteins and organelles within cells (intracellular trafficking). mutations in the chm gene lead to an absence of rep-1 protein or the production of a rep-1 protein that cannot carry out its protein escort function. this lack of functional rep-1 prevents rab proteins from reaching and attaching (binding) to the organelle membranes. without the aid of rab proteins in intracellular trafficking, cells die prematurely.  the rep-1 protein is active (expressed) throughout the body, as is a similar protein, rep-2. research suggests that when rep-1 is absent or nonfunctional, rep-2 can perform the protein escort duties of rep-1 in many of the body's tissues. very little rep-2 protein is present in the retina, however, so it cannot compensate for the loss of rep-1 in this tissue. loss of rep-1 function and subsequent misplacement of rab proteins within the cells of the retina causes the progressive vision loss characteristic of choroideremia."

how to diagnose freeman sheldon syndrome ?,"how is freeman sheldon syndrome diagnosed? freeman sheldon syndrome may be suspected based on medical history and physical examination which reveal characteristic features such as a small mouth, flat mask-like face, club feet, joint contractures, and under-development of the cartilage of the nose. a definitive diagnosis can be made through clinical genetic testing. genetests lists laboratories offering clinical genetic testing for this condition. clinical genetic tests are ordered to help diagnose a person or family and to aid in decisions regarding medical care or reproductive issues. talk to your health care provider or a genetic professional to learn more about your testing options."
what are the genetic changes related to norrie disease ?,"mutations in the ndp gene cause norrie disease.  the ndp gene provides instructions for making a protein called norrin. norrin participates in the wnt cascade, a sequence of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. in particular, norrin seems to play a critical role in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory capabilities. it is also involved in the establishment of a blood supply to tissues of the retina and the inner ear, and the development of other body systems.  in order to initiate the wnt cascade, norrin must bind (attach) to another protein called frizzled-4. mutations in the norrin protein interfere with its ability to bind to frizzled-4, resulting in the signs and symptoms of norrie disease."
what are the genetic changes related to pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis ?,"pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is caused by mutations in the slc34a2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called the type iib sodium-phosphate cotransporter, which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels (phosphate homeostasis). although this protein can be found in several organs and tissues in the body, it is located mainly in the lungs, specifically in cells in the alveoli called alveolar type ii cells. these cells produce and recycle surfactant, which is a mixture of certain phosphate-containing fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy.  the recycling of surfactant releases phosphate into the alveoli. research suggests that the type iib sodium-phosphate cotransporter normally helps clear this phosphate. slc34a2 gene mutations are thought to impair the activity of the type iib sodium-phosphate cotransporter, resulting in the accumulation of phosphate in the alveoli. the accumulated phosphate forms the microliths that cause the signs and symptoms of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis."
what is (are) x-linked infantile nystagmus ?,"x-linked infantile nystagmus is a condition characterized by abnormal eye movements. nystagmus is a term that refers to involuntary side-to-side movements of the eyes. in people with this condition, nystagmus is present at birth or develops within the first six months of life. the abnormal eye movements may worsen when an affected person is feeling anxious or tries to stare directly at an object. the severity of nystagmus varies, even among affected individuals within the same family. sometimes, affected individuals will turn or tilt their head to compensate for the irregular eye movements."
how to diagnose andersen-tawil syndrome ?,"is genetic testing available for andersen-tawil syndrome? yes, the genetic testing registry (gtr) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.  how is andersen-tawil syndrome diagnosed? the diagnosis of andersen-tawil syndrome might be suspected in individuals with either: 1. two of the following three criteria: periodic paralysis symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or evidence of enlarged u-waves, ventricular ectopy, or a prolonged qtc or quc interval on electrocardiogram (ecg)  characteristic facial features, dental abnormalities, small hands and feet, and at least two of the following: low-set ears widely spaced eyes small lower jaw (mandible) fifth-digit clinodactyly (curved pinky finger) syndactyly or 2. one of the above three criteria in addition to at least one other family member who meets two of the three criteria. the presence of a mutation in the kcnj2 gene confirms the diagnosis of andersen-tawil syndrome."
what causes isovaleric acidemia ?,"what causes isovaleric acidemia? isovaleric acidemia is caused by mutations in the ivd gene. the ivd gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. specifically, this enzyme helps process the amino acid leucine, which is part of many proteins. if a mutation in the ivd gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. as a result, an organic acid called isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to harmful levels in the body. this buildup damages the brain and nervous system, causing serious health problems."
what are the genetic changes related to townes-brocks syndrome ?,"mutations in the sall1 gene cause townes-brocks syndrome. the sall1 gene is part of a group of genes called the sall family. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs before birth. sall proteins act as transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to specific regions of dna and help control the activity of particular genes. some mutations in the sall1 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the sall1 protein that malfunctions within the cell. other mutations prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from making any protein. it is unclear how these genetic changes disrupt normal development and cause the birth defects associated with townes-brocks syndrome."

is malignant hyperthermia inherited ?,"malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. in most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is also at risk for the condition."
what is (are) beta-thalassemia ?,"beta-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. low levels of hemoglobin lead to a shortage of mature red blood cells and a lack of oxygen in the body. affected people have anemia, which can cause paleness, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. severe beta-thalassemia is called thalassemia major or cooleys anemia. thalassemia intermedia is a less severe form. beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the hbb gene and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. people who have only one hbb gene mutation may have no symptoms or develop mild symptoms, and are said to have thalassemia minor. treatment depends on the severity in each person and may include transfusions, folic acid supplementation, iron chelation, and/or bone marrow transplantation (the only definitive cure)."
what are the treatments for uncombable hair syndrome ?,"how might uncombable hair syndrome be treated? there is no definitive treatment for uncombable hair syndrome, but the condition usually improves or resolves on its own with the onset of puberty. gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. these strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective. another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use of biotin supplements. one case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation."
how many people are affected by heart attack ?,"very common. each year, more than 1 million people in the u.s. have a heart attack and about half of them die. about one-half of those who die do so within 1 hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital."
what are the genetic changes related to timothy syndrome ?,"mutations in the cacna1c gene are responsible for all reported cases of timothy syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a channel across cell membranes. this channel, known as cav1.2, is one of several channels that transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells. calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes. cav1.2 calcium channels are particularly important for the normal function of heart and brain cells. in cardiac muscle, these channels play a critical role in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. their role in the brain and in other tissues is less clear.  mutations in the cacna1c gene change the structure of cav1.2 channels. the altered channels stay open much longer than usual, which allows calcium ions to continue flowing into cells abnormally. the resulting overload of calcium ions within cardiac muscle cells changes the way the heart beats and can cause arrhythmia. researchers are working to determine how an increase in calcium ion transport in other tissues, including cells in the brain, underlies the other features of timothy syndrome."

your doctor will want to know about your history of asbestos exposure. he or she may ask about your work history and your spouse's or other family members work histories.
                
your doctor also may ask about your location and surroundings. for example, he or she may ask about areas of the country where you've lived.
                
if you know you were exposed to asbestos, your doctor may ask questions to find out:
                
how much asbestos you were exposed to. for example, were you surrounded by visible asbestos dust?
                
how long you were exposed to asbestos and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it.
                
symptoms
                
your doctor may ask whether you have any symptoms, such as shortness of breath or coughing. the symptoms of asbestos-related lung diseases vary. they depend on which disease you have and how much it has damaged your lungs.
                
your doctor also may ask whether you smoke. smoking, along with asbestos exposure, raises your risk for lung cancer.
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any strange sounds.
                
if you have a pleural effusion with a lot of fluid buildup, your doctor might hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. or, he or she might have trouble hearing any breathing sounds. if you have asbestosis, your doctor may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in.
                
your doctor will check your legs for swelling, which may be a sign of lung-related problems. he or she also will check your fingers and toes for clubbing.
                
clubbing is the widening and rounding of the fingertips and toes. clubbing most often is linked to heart and lung diseases that cause lower-than-normal blood oxygen levels.
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray is the most common test for detecting asbestos-related lung diseases. this painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as the lungs.
                
a chest x ray cant detect asbestos fibers in the lungs. however, it can show asbestos-related diseases, such as pleural plaque and pleural effusion. pleural effusion also can be a sign of a more severe disease, such as mesothelioma.
                
a chest x ray also can show asbestosis. often the lung tissue will appear very white on the x-ray pictures. the size, shape, location, and degree of whiteness can help your doctor figure out how much lung damage you have. severe asbestosis may affect the whole lung and have a honeycomb look on the x-ray pictures.
                
if you have lung cancer, a chest x ray may show masses or abnormal fluid.
                
if you have mesothelioma, a chest x ray will show thickening of the pleura. the pleura is the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). the chest xray also will usually show signs of pleural effusion in people who have mesothelioma.
                
other diagnostic tests
                
to help confirm a chest x-ray finding, or to find out how much lung damage you have, you may have more tests.
                
chest computed tomography scan
                
a chest computed tomography (to-mog-ra-fee) scan, or chest ct scan, is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your lungs. a ct scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than standard chest x-ray pictures.
                
a chest ct scan may be very helpful for finding asbestosis in its earliest stages, before a standard chest x ray can detect it.
                
lung function tests
                
lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.
                
these tests can show whether your lung function is impaired. they also can help your doctor track your disease over time.
                
biopsy
                
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of lung cancer or mesothelioma is for a pathologist to check samples of your lung cells or tissues. a pathologist is a doctor who identifies diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.
                
doctors have many ways to collect tissue samples. one way is through bronchoscopy (bron-kos-ko-pee). for this procedure, your doctor will pass a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. he or she will then take a sample of tissue from your lungs.
                
if your doctor thinks you have mesothelioma, you may have a thoracoscopy (thor-ah-kos-ko-pee). for this procedure, you'll be given medicine so you don't feel any pain.
                
your doctor will make a small cut through your chest wall. he or she will put a thin tube with a light on it into your chest between two ribs. this allows your doctor to see inside your chest and get tissue samples."
what are the symptoms of pseudodiastrophic dysplasia ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of pseudodiastrophic dysplasia? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for pseudodiastrophic dysplasia. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% elbow dislocation 90% hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% scoliosis 90% omphalocele 7.5% autosomal recessive inheritance - fever - hypoplasia of midface - hypoplasia of the odontoid process - lumbar hyperlordosis - malar flattening - phalangeal dislocation - platyspondyly - rhizomelia - severe short stature - talipes equinovarus - tongue-like lumbar vertebral deformities - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to androgen insensitivity syndrome ?,"mutations in the ar gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. androgen receptors allow cells to respond to androgens, which are hormones (such as testosterone) that direct male sexual development. androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive. mutations in the ar gene prevent androgen receptors from working properly, which makes cells less responsive to androgens or prevents cells from using these hormones at all. depending on the level of androgen insensitivity, an affected person's sex characteristics can vary from mostly female to mostly male."
what causes sickle cell disease ?,"abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin s, causes sickle cell disease (scd).
                
the problem in hemoglobin s is caused by a small defect in the gene that directs the production of the beta globin part of hemoglobin. this small defect in the beta globin gene causes a problem in the beta globin part of hemoglobin, changing the way that hemoglobin works. (see overview.)
                

                
how is sickle cell disease inherited?
                
when the hemoglobin s gene is inherited from only one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene is inherited from the other, a person will have sickle cell trait. people with sickle cell trait are generally healthy.
                
only rarely do people with sickle cell trait have complications similar to those seen in people with scd. but people with sickle cell trait are carriers of a defective hemoglobin s gene. so, they can pass it on when they have a child.
                
if the childs other parent also has sickle cell trait or another abnormal hemoglobin gene (like thalassemia, hemoglobin c, hemoglobin d, hemoglobin e), that child has a chance of having scd.
                
example of an inheritance pattern
                

                
in the image above, each parent has one hemoglobin a gene and one hemoglobin s gene, and each of their children has:
                
a 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal genes: in this case the child does not have sickle cell trait or disease. (case 1)
                
a 50 percent chance of inheriting one hemoglobin a gene and one hemoglobin s gene: this child has sickle cell trait. (cases 2 and 3)
                
a 25 percent chance of inheriting two hemoglobin s genes: this child has sickle cell disease. (case 4)
                
it is important to keep in mind that each time this couple has a child, the chances of that child having sickle cell disease remain the same. in other words, if the first-born child has sickle cell disease, there is still a 25 percent chance that the second child will also have the disease. both boys and girls can inherit sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease, or normal hemoglobin.
                
if a person wants to know if he or she carries a sickle hemoglobin gene, a doctor can order a blood test to find out."
what are the symptoms of bartter syndrome antenatal type 1 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of bartter syndrome antenatal type 1? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for bartter syndrome antenatal type 1. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) autosomal recessive inheritance - chondrocalcinosis - constipation - dehydration - diarrhea - failure to thrive - fetal polyuria - fever - generalized muscle weakness - hyperactive renin-angiotensin system - hyperaldosteronism - hypercalciuria - hyperchloridura - hyperprostaglandinuria - hypochloremia - hypokalemia - hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis - hypomagnesemia - hyposthenuria - increased circulating renin level - increased serum prostaglandin e2 - increased urinary potassium - intellectual disability - low-to-normal blood pressure - muscle cramps - nephrocalcinosis - osteopenia - paresthesia - polyhydramnios - polyuria - premature birth - renal juxtaglomerular cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia - renal potassium wasting - renal salt wasting - seizures - short stature - small for gestational age - tetany - vomiting - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for arginase deficiency ?,"how might arginase deficiency be treated? the treatment and management of arginase deficiency is generally focused on lowering arginine levels and preventing hyperammonemia (an accumulation of ammonia in the blood). this may be accomplished through dietary modifications and the use of certain medications (called nitrogen-scavenging drugs) under the supervision of a medical team with experience treating metabolic conditions. more specifically, people affected by arginase deficiency must restrict dietary protein and arginine. this is often achieved with the use of specialized formulas, which may account for half or more of protein intake. although people with arginase deficiency are less prone to episodes of severe hyperammonemia than people affected by other urea cycle disorders, special treatment is needed should these episodes occur. during an episode, affected people are generally treated in the hospital and may require dialysis, nitrogen-scavenging medications, intravenous (iv) fluids/feeds and/or other treatments. these treatments are administered with the goal of rapidly reducing blood ammonia levels and preventing neurological damage. genereviews offers more specific information on the treatment of arginase deficiency and urea cycle disorders, in general. please click on the links to access these resources."
what are the genetic changes related to neuromyelitis optica ?,"no genes associated with neuromyelitis optica have been identified. however, a small percentage of people with this condition have a family member who is also affected, which indicates that there may be one or more genetic changes that increase susceptibility. it is thought that the inheritance of this condition is complex and that many environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of the condition.  the aquaporin-4 protein (aqp4), a normal protein in the body, plays a role in neuromyelitis optica. the aquaporin-4 protein is found in several body systems but is most abundant in tissues of the central nervous system. approximately 70 percent of people with this disorder produce an immune protein called an antibody that attaches (binds) to the aquaporin-4 protein. antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibody in people with neuromyelitis optica attacks a normal human protein; this type of antibody is called an autoantibody. the autoantibody in this condition is called nmo-igg or anti-aqp4.  the binding of the nmo-igg autoantibody to the aquaporin-4 protein turns on (activates) the complement system, which is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy pathogens, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. complement activation leads to the inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord that is characteristic of neuromyelitis optica, resulting in the signs and symptoms of the condition.  the levels of the nmo-igg autoantibody are high during episodes of neuromyelitis optica, and the levels decrease between episodes with treatment of the disorder. however, it is unclear what triggers episodes to begin or end."
what are the symptoms of renal dysplasia-limb defects syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of renal dysplasia-limb defects syndrome? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for renal dysplasia-limb defects syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% abnormality of the fibula 90% abnormality of the palate 90% abnormality of the ulna 90% aplasia/hypoplasia of the lungs 90% aplasia/hypoplasia of the radius 90% convex nasal ridge 90% intrauterine growth retardation 90% micromelia 90% multicystic kidney dysplasia 90% narrow mouth 90% oligohydramnios 90% respiratory insufficiency 90% short stature 90% talipes 90% abnormality of the ribs 50% aplasia/hypoplasia of the cerebellum 50% cleft upper lip 50% humeroradial synostosis 50% renal hypoplasia/aplasia 50% short neck 50% abnormality of the pinna - absent ulna - autosomal recessive inheritance - clitoral hypertrophy - cryptorchidism - depressed nasal bridge - fibular aplasia - high palate - hypoplasia of the radius - low-set ears - maternal diabetes - neonatal death - phocomelia - pneumothorax - prominent occiput - pulmonary hypoplasia - renal dysplasia - renal hypoplasia - respiratory distress - respiratory failure - short metacarpal - short ribs - short sternum - single umbilical artery - talipes equinovarus - thin ribs - thin vermilion border - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what is (are) werner syndrome ?,"werner syndrome is characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of features associated with normal aging. individuals with this disorder typically grow and develop normally until they reach puberty. affected teenagers usually do not have a growth spurt, resulting in short stature. the characteristic aged appearance of individuals with werner syndrome typically begins to develop when they are in their twenties and includes graying and loss of hair; a hoarse voice; and thin, hardened skin. they may also have a facial appearance described as ""bird-like."" many people with werner syndrome have thin arms and legs and a thick trunk due to abnormal fat deposition.  as werner syndrome progresses, affected individuals may develop disorders of aging early in life, such as cloudy lenses (cataracts) in both eyes, skin ulcers, type 2 diabetes, diminished fertility, severe hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), and some types of cancer. it is not uncommon for affected individuals to develop multiple, rare cancers during their lifetime. people with werner syndrome usually live into their late forties or early fifties. the most common causes of death are cancer and atherosclerosis."
what are the genetic changes related to hereditary hemochromatosis ?,"mutations in the hamp, hfe, hfe2, slc40a1, and tfr2 genes cause hereditary hemochromatosis. type 1 hemochromatosis results from mutations in the hfe gene, and type 2 hemochromatosis results from mutations in either the hfe2 or hamp gene. mutations in the tfr2 gene cause type 3 hemochromatosis, and mutations in the slc40a1 gene cause type 4 hemochromatosis.  the proteins produced from these genes play important roles in regulating the absorption, transport, and storage of iron. mutations in any of these genes impair the control of iron absorption during digestion and alter the distribution of iron to other parts of the body. as a result, iron accumulates in tissues and organs, which can disrupt their normal functions."
is thiopurine s-methyltransferase deficiency inherited ?,"the activity of the tpmt enzyme is inherited in a pattern described as autosomal codominant. codominance means that two different versions of the gene are active (expressed), and both versions influence the genetic trait.  the tpmt gene can be classified as either low-activity or high-activity. when the gene is altered in a way that impairs the activity of the tpmt enzyme, it is described as low-activity. when the gene is unaltered and tpmt activity is normal, it is described as high-activity. because two copies of the gene are present in each cell, each person can have two low-activity copies, one low-activity copy and one high-activity copy, or two high-activity copies.  people with two low-activity copies of the tpmt gene in each cell have tpmt deficiency and are at the greatest risk of developing hematopoietic toxicity when treated with thiopurine drugs unless they are given much less than the usual dose. people with one high-activity copy and one low-activity copy have moderately reduced enzyme activity and are also at increased risk of this complication unless given a significantly lower dose of the drug. people with two high-activity copies have normal tpmt activity and do not have an increased risk of hematopoietic toxicity with thiopurine drug treatment."
what are the genetic changes related to hidradenitis suppurativa ?,"in most cases, the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unknown. the condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. originally, researchers believed that the disorder was caused by the blockage of specialized sweat glands called apocrine glands. however, recent studies have shown that the condition actually begins with a blockage of hair follicles in areas of the body that also contain a high concentration of apocrine glands (such as the armpits and groin). the blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, leading to inflammation and rupture. it remains unclear what initially causes the follicles to become blocked and why the nodules tend to recur.  genetic factors clearly play a role in causing hidradenitis suppurativa. some cases have been found to result from mutations in the ncstn, psen1, or psenen gene. the proteins produced from these genes are all components of a complex called gamma- (-) secretase. this complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways. one of these pathways, known as notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function. studies suggest that mutations in the ncstn, psen1, or psenen gene impair notch signaling in hair follicles. although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and lead to inflammation in the skin. researchers are working to determine whether additional genes, particularly those that provide instructions for making other -secretase components, are also associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.  researchers have studied many other possible risk factors for hidradenitis suppurativa. obesity and smoking both appear to increase the risk of the disorder, and obesity is also associated with increased severity of signs and symptoms in affected individuals. studies suggest that neither abnormal immune system function nor hormonal factors play a significant role in causing the disease. other factors that were mistakenly thought to be associated with this condition include poor hygiene, the use of underarm deodorants and antiperspirants, and shaving or the use of depilatory products to remove hair."
what are the genetic changes related to late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ?,"mutations in the tpp1 gene cause most cases of late-infantile ncl. mutations in the cln5, cln6, cln8, mfsd8, and ppt1 genes each account for a small percentage of cases.  the tpp1 gene produces an enzyme called tripeptidyl peptidase 1. this enzyme is found in cell structures called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. tripeptidyl peptidase 1 breaks down protein fragments, known as peptides, into their individual building blocks (amino acids).  the proteins produced from the other genes involved in this condition are active either in lysosomes or in another cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. the endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. within these cell structures, the proteins largely play roles in the breakdown of other proteins or substances.  mutations in the tpp1, cln5, cln6, cln8, mfsd8, or ppt1 gene usually reduce the production or activity of the particular protein or enzyme made from the gene. in many cases, a reduction in functional protein or enzyme results in incomplete breakdown of certain proteins and other materials. these materials accumulate in the lysosome forming fatty substances called lipopigments. in some cases, it is unclear what causes the buildup of lipopigments. in late-infantile ncl, these accumulations occur in cells throughout the body, but neurons seem particularly vulnerable to damage caused by lipopigments and a decrease in specific protein function. the progressive death of cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of late-infantile ncl."
what is (are) turner syndrome ?,"turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects development in females. it is characterized by a person having one x chromosome in each cell (females without turner syndrome have two x chromosomes in each cell). signs and symptoms may include short stature; premature ovarian failure; a ""webbed"" neck; a low hairline at the back of the neck; and swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet. some people with turner syndrome have skeletal abnormalities, kidney problems, and/or a congenital heart defect. most affected girls and women have normal intelligence, but some have developmental delays, learning disabilities, and/or behavior problems. turner syndrome is typically not inherited, but it can be inherited in rare cases. treatment may include growth hormone therapy for short stature and estrogen therapy to help stimulate sexual development. while most women with turner syndrome are infertile, assisted reproductive techniques can help some women become pregnant."
how to prevent colorectal cancer ?,"key points
                    - avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.    - the following risk factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:         - age     - family history of colorectal cancer     - personal history     - inherited risk     - alcohol     - cigarette smoking     - obesity        - the following protective factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:         - physical activity     - aspirin     - combination hormone replacement therapy      - polyp removal        - it is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:         - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) other than aspirin     - calcium     - diet        - the following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:         - hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only     - statins        - cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.    - new ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                
                
                    avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    the following risk factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    age    the risk of colorectal cancer increases after age 50. most cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed after age 50.       family history of colorectal cancer    having a parent, brother, sister, or child with colorectal cancer doubles a person's risk of colorectal cancer.       personal history    having a personal history of the following conditions increases the risk of colorectal cancer:             - previous colorectal cancer.     - high-risk adenomas (colorectal polyps that are 1 centimeter or larger in size or that have cells that look abnormal under a microscope).     -  ovarian cancer.     -  inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or crohn disease).              inherited risk    the risk of colorectal cancer is increased when certain gene changes linked to familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (hnpcc or lynch syndrome) are inherited.       alcohol    drinking 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day increases the risk of colorectal cancer. drinking alcohol is also linked to the risk of forming large colorectal adenomas (benign tumors).       cigarette smoking    cigarette smoking is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.    smoking cigarettes is also linked to an increased risk of forming colorectal adenomas. cigarette smokers who have had surgery to remove colorectal adenomas are at an increased risk for the adenomas to recur (come back).       obesity     obesity is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.
                
                
                    the following protective factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    physical activity    a lifestyle that includes regular physical activity is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.       aspirin    studies have shown that taking aspirin lowers the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from colorectal cancer. the decrease in risk begins 10 to 20 years after patients start taking aspirin.    the possible harms of aspirin use (100 mg or less) daily or every other day include an increased risk of stroke and bleeding in the stomach and intestines. these risks may be greater among the elderly, men, and those with conditions linked to a higher than normal risk of bleeding.       combination hormone replacement therapy      studies have shown that combination hormone replacement therapy (hrt) that includes both estrogen and progestin lowers the risk of invasive colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women.     however, in women who take combination hrt and do develop colorectal cancer, the cancer is more likely to be advanced when it is diagnosed and the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is not decreased.    the possible harms of combination hrt include an increased risk of having:            -  breast cancer.     - heart disease.     -  blood clots.              polyp removal    most colorectal polyps are adenomas, which may develop into cancer. removing colorectal polyps that are larger than 1 centimeter (pea-sized) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. it is not known if removing smaller polyps lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     the possible harms of polyp removal during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy include a tear in the wall of the colon and bleeding.
                
                
                    it is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) other than aspirin    it is not known if the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nsaids (such as sulindac, celecoxib, naproxen, and ibuprofen) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     studies have shown that taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas (benign tumors) coming back after they have been removed. it is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.     taking sulindac or celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of polyps that form in the colon and rectum of people with familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). it is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.    the possible harms of nsaids include:            -  kidney problems.     - bleeding in the stomach, intestines, or brain.     - heart problems such as heart attack and congestive heart failure.              calcium    it is not known if taking calcium supplements lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.        diet    it is not known if a diet low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     some studies have shown that a diet high in fat, proteins, calories, and meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer, but other studies have not.
                
                
                    the following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only    hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only does not lower the risk of having invasive colorectal cancer or the risk of dying from colorectal cancer.       statins    studies have shown that taking statins (drugs that lower cholesterol) does not increase or decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.
                
                
                    cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.     the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    new ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci website. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for colon cancer prevention trials or rectal cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients."
what to do for financial help for diabetes care ?,"- diabetes management and treatment is expensive. many people who have diabetes need help paying for their care. for those who qualify, a variety of government and nongovernment programs can help cover health care expenses.  - health insurance helps pay for medical care, including the cost of diabetes care. health insurance options include private health insurance and government health insurance.  - insurance companies sell private health insurance plans. two types of private health insurance are group health insurance and individual health insurance.  - medicare is a federal health insurance program that pays health care costs for eligible people who are age 65 or older, under age 65 with certain disabilities, or of any age with end-stage renal disease.  - medicaid is a state health insurance program for those with low incomes and few assets. each state runs its own program.  - the childrens health insurance program (chip) gives free or low-cost medicaid to children whose parents earn too much for medicaid, though not enough to pay for a health plan.  - many local governments have public health departments that can help people who need medical care. local resources such as charitable groups may offer financial help for some expenses related to diabetes.  - people should talk with their health care providers if they have problems paying for diabetes medications. less expensive generic medications for diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol are available. if a health care provider prescribes medications that a person cannot afford, the person should ask the health care provider about cheaper alternatives.  - health care providers may also be able to assist people who need help paying for their medications and diabetes testing supplies, such as glucose test strips, by providing free samples or referring them to local programs. drug companies that sell insulin or diabetes medications often have patient assistance programs."

what is (are) stroke ?,"a stroke is a medical emergency. strokes happen when blood flow to your brain stops. within minutes, brain cells begin to die. there are two kinds of stroke. the more common kind, called ischemic stroke, is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. the other kind, called hemorrhagic stroke, is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. ""mini-strokes"" or transient ischemic attacks (tias), occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.    symptoms of stroke are        - sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)    - sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech    - sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination    - sudden severe headache with no known cause       if you have any of these symptoms, you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment. acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot or by stopping the bleeding. post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. drug therapy with blood thinners is the most common treatment for stroke.     nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke"
what to do for gastroparesis ?,"- gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.  - gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.  - most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests.  - diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. people with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve.  - the most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food sometimes several hours after a meal. other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (ger), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite.  - gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, and gastric emptying tests.  - changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. a health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. when a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pured diet may be prescribed.  - treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.  - for people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the persons insulin regimen."
how to prevent stroke ?,"taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay a stroke. if youve already had a stroke, these actions can help prevent another one.
                
be physically active. physical activity can improve your fitness level and health. talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of activity are safe for you.
                
dont smoke, or if you smoke or use tobacco, quit. smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk of stroke. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. also, secondhand smoke can damage the bloodvessels.
                
maintain a healthy weight. if youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight loss plan. controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for stroke.

manage stress. use techniques to lower your stress levels.
                
if you or someone in your family has had a stroke, be sure to tell your doctor. by knowing your family history of stroke, you may be able to lower your risk factors and prevent or delay a stroke. if youve had a transient ischemic attack (tia), dont ignore it. tias are warnings, and its important for your doctor to find the cause of the tia so you can take steps to prevent a stroke."
who is at risk for nocardiosis? ?,"people with very weak immune (body defense) systems are at risk for getting nocardiosis. 
    
several diseases and circumstances can cause the immune system to be weak. these include:
    
     - diabetes
     - cancer
     - hiv/aids
     - pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (an illness that causes the air sacs of the lungs to become plugged)
     - connective tissue disorder (a disease that affects the tissue that connects and supports different parts of the body)
     - alcoholism
     - having a bone marrow or solid organ transplant
     - taking high doses of drugs called corticosteroids
    
    
in the united states, it has been estimated that 500-1,000 new cases of nocardiosis infection occur every year. approximately 60% of nocardiosis cases are associated with pre-existing immune compromise. 
    
in addition, men have a greater risk of getting the infection than women; for every female who gets sick with nocardiosis, there are about 3 males who get the disease."
what is (are) diabetes ?,"diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. it stays in your blood instead. your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes."
what is (are) urachal cyst ?,"urachal cyst is a sac-like pocket of tissue that develops in the urachus, a primitive structure that connects the umbilical cord to the bladder in the developing baby. although it normally disappears prior to birth, part of the urachus may remain in some people. urachal cysts can develop at any age, but typically affect older children and adults. urachal cysts are often not associated with any signs or symptoms unless there are complications such as infection. in these cases, symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, pain with urination and/or hematuria. treatment typically includes surgery to drain the cyst and/or remove the urachus."

what causes insomnia ?,"secondary insomnia
                
secondary insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem. this type of insomnia often is a symptom of an emotional, neurological, or other medical or sleep disorder.
                
emotional disorders that can cause insomnia include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease are examples of neurological disorders that can cause insomnia.
                
many other disorders or factors also can cause insomnia, such as:
                
conditions that cause chronic (ongoing) pain, such as arthritis and headache disorders
                
conditions that make it hard to breathe, such as asthma and heart failure
                
an overactive thyroid
                
gastrointestinal disorders, such as heartburn
                
stroke
                
sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-related breathing problems
                
menopause and hot flashes
                
secondary insomnia also can be a side effect of some medicines. for example, certain asthma medicines, such as theophylline, and some allergy and cold medicines can cause insomnia. beta blockers also can cause the condition. these medicines are used to treat heart conditions.
                
commonly used substances also can cause insomnia. examples include caffeine and other stimulants, tobacco and other nicotine products, and alcohol and other sedatives.
                
primary insomnia
                
primary insomnia isn't a symptom or side effect of another medical condition. it is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isnt well understood. primary insomnia usually lasts for at least 1 month.
                
many life changes can trigger primary insomnia. it may be due to major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset. travel or other factors, such as work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine, also may trigger primary insomnia.
                
even if these issues are resolved, the insomnia may not go away. trouble sleeping can persist because of habits formed to deal with the lack of sleep. these habits might include taking naps, worrying about sleep, and going to bed early.
                
researchers continue to try to find out whether some people are born with an increased risk for primary insomnia."

what is (are) aromatase deficiency ?,"aromatase deficiency is a condition characterized by reduced levels of the female sex hormone estrogen and increased levels of the male sex hormone testosterone.  females with aromatase deficiency have a typical female chromosome pattern (46,xx) but are born with external genitalia that do not appear clearly female or male (ambiguous genitalia). these individuals typically have normal internal reproductive organs, but develop ovarian cysts early in childhood, which impair the release of egg cells from the ovaries (ovulation). in adolescence, most affected females do not develop secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast growth and menstrual periods. they tend to develop acne and excessive body hair growth (hirsutism).  men with this condition have a typical male chromosome pattern (46,xy) and are born with male external genitalia. some men with this condition have decreased sex drive, abnormal sperm production, or testes that are small or undescended (cryptorchidism).  there are other features associated with aromatase deficiency that can affect both males and females. affected individuals are abnormally tall because of excessive growth of long bones in the arms and legs. the abnormal bone growth results in slowed mineralization of bones (delayed bone age) and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), which can lead to bone fractures with little trauma. males and females with aromatase deficiency can have abnormally high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) because the body does not respond correctly to the hormone insulin. in addition, they can have excessive weight gain and a fatty liver.  women who are pregnant with fetuses that have aromatase deficiency often experience mild symptoms of the disorder even though they themselves do not have the disorder. these women may develop hirsutism, acne, an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly), and a deep voice. these features can appear as early as 12 weeks of pregnancy and go away soon after delivery."
what is (are) hypophosphatasia ?,"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is a genetic condition that causes abnormal development of the bones and teeth. the severity of hpp can vary widely, from fetal death to fractures that don't begin until adulthood. signs and symptoms may include poor feeding and respiratory problems in infancy; short stature; weak and soft bones; short limbs; other skeletal abnormalities; and hypercalcemia. complications can be life-threatening. the mildest form of the condition, called odontohypophosphatasia, only affects the teeth. hpp is caused by mutations in the alpl gene. perinatal (onset before birth) and infantile hpp are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. the milder forms, especially adult forms and odontohypophosphatasia, may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner. while treatment has always been symptomatic and supportive, recently an enzyme replacement therapy (ert) called asfotase alfa has been show to improve bone manifestations people with childhood onset hpp and has been approved by the fda."

what is (are) asperger syndrome ?,"asperger syndrome is a disorder on the autism spectrum, which is a group of conditions characterized by impaired communication and social interaction. asperger syndrome is on the mild, or ""high-functioning,"" end of the autism spectrum. many affected individuals learn to compensate for their differences and live independent and successful lives. however, the behavioral challenges associated with this condition often lead to social isolation and difficulties at school, at work, and in personal relationships.  people with asperger syndrome have average or above-average intelligence. in contrast to people with other disorders on the autism spectrum, they are not delayed in their language development. however, their ability to carry on a conversation is often impaired by a tendency to take idioms or humorous statements literally and an inability to read non-verbal cues such as body language to understand what others are feeling. they may speak in a monotone voice, have unusual mannerisms, or choose unusual topics of conversation.  individuals with asperger syndrome tend to develop an intense interest in a particular subject. this interest may be a traditional hobby or academic discipline, and many people with asperger syndrome develop advanced abilities in fields such as music, science, mathematics, or computer programming. however, they might also focus on an unusual interest such as bus routes or a particular type of household appliance. often they are able to remember enormous amounts of detail on their subject of interest. they may want to share this large amount of information with others and may resist diversion to other topics.  people with asperger syndrome tend to be rigid about their established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in schedule. they may also have difficulty tolerating sensory stimuli such as noise or lights.  other features of asperger syndrome may include mild impairment of motor skills. for example, basic skills such as crawling and walking may be somewhat delayed. affected individuals may also have coordination problems that impair their ability to engage in such activities as playing ball games or riding a bicycle. this physical clumsiness may lead to further social isolation of children with asperger syndrome.  signs and symptoms of asperger syndrome may become apparent by the age of 3, when most children begin to develop social skills such as learning to play with others. some affected children may come to medical attention due to delayed motor skills. in most cases, children with asperger syndrome are diagnosed during the elementary school years, as their social behavior continues to diverge from the typical developmental path. difficulties with social skills generally continue into adulthood, and affected individuals are at increased risk of other behavioral or psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (adhd), depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder."
is beckwith-wiedemann syndrome inherited ?,"in about 85 percent of cases of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome, only one person in a family has been diagnosed with the condition. however, parents of one child with beckwith-wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. this risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.  another 10 to 15 percent of people with beckwith-wiedemann syndrome are part of families with more than one affected family member. in most of these families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. in most of these cases, individuals with beckwith-wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.  rarely, beckwith-wiedemann syndrome results from changes in the structure of chromosome 11. some of these chromosomal abnormalities are inherited from a parent, while others occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in the earliest stages of development before birth."
what is (are) earthquakes ?,"an earthquake happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. earthquakes strike suddenly, violently, and without warning at any time of the day or night. if an earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause property damage, injuries, and even deaths. if you live in a coastal area, there is the possibility of a tsunami. damage from earthquakes can also lead to floods or fires.    although there are no guarantees of safety during an earthquake, you can take actions to protect yourself. you should have a disaster plan. being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. if you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. you may need help in finding ways to cope.    federal emergency management agency"

what are the genetic changes related to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia ?,"cda type i usually results from mutations in the cdan1 gene. little is known about the function of this gene, and it is unclear how mutations cause the characteristic features of cda type i. some people with this condition do not have identified mutations in the cdan1 gene, leading researchers to believe that mutations in at least one other gene can also cause this form of the disorder.  cda type ii is caused by mutations in the sec23b gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the transport of other proteins within cells. during the development of red blood cells, this protein may help ensure that proteins are transported to the areas where they are needed. researchers are working to determine how mutations in the sec23b gene lead to the signs and symptoms of cda type ii.  the genetic cause of cda type iii has not been identified. it likely results from mutations in a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at a position designated 15q22. researchers continue to search for the specific gene associated with this form of the condition.  the genetic changes responsible for cda disrupt the normal development of red blood cells, a process called erythropoiesis. the term ""dyserythropoietic"" in the name of this condition means abnormal red blood cell formation. in people with cda, immature red blood cells called erythroblasts are unusually shaped and have other abnormalities (such as extra nuclei). these abnormal erythroblasts cannot develop into functional mature red blood cells. the resulting shortage of healthy red blood cells leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of anemia, as well as complications including hepatosplenomegaly and an abnormal buildup of iron."

how to prevent parasites - fascioliasis (fasciola infection) ?,"no vaccine is available to protect people against fasciola infection.
    
in some areas of the world where fascioliasis is found (endemic), special control programs are in place or are planned. the types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors). strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important.
    
individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. as always, travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). vegetables grown in fields that might have been irrigated with polluted water should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals."
what is (are) tuberous sclerosis complex ?,"tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous noncancerous (benign) tumors in many parts of the body. these tumors can occur in the skin, brain, kidneys, and other organs, in some cases leading to significant health problems. tuberous sclerosis complex also causes developmental problems, and the signs and symptoms of the condition vary from person to person.  virtually all affected people have skin abnormalities, including patches of unusually light-colored skin, areas of raised and thickened skin, and growths under the nails. tumors on the face called facial angiofibromas are also common beginning in childhood.  tuberous sclerosis complex often affects the brain, causing seizures, behavioral problems such as hyperactivity and aggression, and intellectual disability or learning problems. some affected children have the characteristic features of autism, a developmental disorder that affects communication and social interaction. benign brain tumors can also develop in people with tuberous sclerosis complex; these tumors can cause serious or life-threatening complications.  kidney tumors are common in people with tuberous sclerosis complex; these growths can cause severe problems with kidney function and may be life-threatening in some cases. additionally, tumors can develop in the heart, lungs, and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina)."
what is (are) hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ?,"hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (hed) is a genetic skin disease. common symptoms include sparse scalp and body hair, reduced ability to sweat, and missing teeth. hed is caused by mutations in the eda, edar, or edaradd genes. it may be inherited in an x-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant manner depending on the genetic cause of the condition. the x-linked form is the most common form. the forms have similar signs and symptoms, however the the autosomal dominant form tends to be the mildest. treatment of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia may include special hair care formulas or wigs, measures to prevent overheating, removal of ear and nose concretions, and dental evaluations and treatment (e.g., restorations, dental implants, or dentures)."

what causes cystic fibrosis ?,"a defect in the cftr gene causes cystic fibrosis (cf). this gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. in people who have cf, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. this causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat.
                
research suggests that the cftr protein also affects the body in other ways. this may help explain other symptoms and complications of cf.
                
more than a thousand known defects can affect the cftr gene. the type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of cf. other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease.
                
how is cystic fibrosis inherited?
                
every person inherits two cftr genesone from each parent. children who inherit a faulty cftr gene from each parent will have cf.
                
children who inherit one faulty cftr gene and one normal cftr gene are ""cf carriers."" cf carriers usually have no symptoms of cf and live normal lives. however, they can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children.
                
the image below shows how two parents who are both cf carriers can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children.

what are the treatments for paget's disease of bone ?,"early diagnosis is important although there is no cure for paget's disease of bone, it is treatable. treatment is most effective when the disease is diagnosed early, before it causes major changes in the affected bones. the goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the disease from progressing. medications are available the food and drug administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow down the progression of the disease and reduce pain and other symptoms. these medications fall into two categories: bisphosphonates and calcitonin. both medications work by stopping or reducing the excessive breakdown of old bone that leads to excessive formation of new, but weaker, bone. people with paget's disease should talk to their doctors about which medication is right for them. bisphosphonates six bisphosphonates are currently available for patients with paget's disease. doctors most commonly recommend the strongest ones, which include - risedronate  - alendronate   - pamidronate   - zoledronic acid   - tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients.  risedronate alendronate pamidronate zoledronic acid tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients. some of the bisphosphonates approved for the treatment of paget's disease, including risedronate and alendronate, are also approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. however, people with paget's disease must take higher dosages of these medicines for shorter periods of time than people with osteoporosis. calcitonin doctors also may prescribe calcitonin to treat paget's disease in some people, although it has been found to be less effective than bisphosphonates. calcitonin is a naturally occurring hormone made by the thyroid gland. your doctor may recommend that you repeat calcitonin treatments with brief rest periods in between treatments. the nasal spray form of calcitonin is not recommended or approved to treat paget's disease. surgery surgery may be a treatment option for some people. hip or knee replacement surgery may help people with severe arthritis. surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position. nutrition and exercise good nutrition and exercise are important for bone health, and that is true for people with paget's disease as well. women over age 50 should consume 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium daily. men between the ages of 51 and 70 should consume 1,000 mg of calcium a day, and men over 70 should consume 1,200 mg per day. people ages 51 to 70 should consume at least 600 international units (iu) of vitamin d daily. people over age 70 should consume at least 800 ius daily. calcium keeps bones strong, and vitamin d helps the body absorb calcium. exercise is very important in maintaining bone health, avoiding weight gain, and keeping joints mobile. however, people with paget's disease need to avoid putting too much stress on affected bones. they should discuss their exercise program with their doctor to make sure it is a good one for them. finding new treatments recently, there have been major advances in the treatment of paget's disease of bone. research into new treatments continues. some researchers are trying to identify the genetic and viral causes of the disease. other researchers are learning more about bone biology to better understand how the body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone."
what is (are) ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ?,"ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. the nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.  ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency often becomes evident in the first few days of life. an infant with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature. some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. complications from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.  in some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life."
what are the stages of oropharyngeal cancer ?,"key points
                    - after oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - the following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:         - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i     - stage ii     - stage iii     - stage iv
                
                
                    after oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the results of some of the tests used to diagnose oropharyngeal cancer are often used to stage the disease.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if oropharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually oropharyngeal cancer cells. the disease is metastatic oropharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:
                    stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the oropharynx. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        stage i    in stage i, cancer has formed and is 2 centimeters or smaller and is found in the oropharynx only.       stage ii    in stage ii, the cancer is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and is found in the oropharynx only.        stage iii    in stage iii, the cancer is either:            - 4 centimeters or smaller; cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - larger than 4 centimeters or has spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing). cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.              stage iv     stage iv is divided into stage iva, ivb, and ivc:            - in stage iva, cancer:                  - has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing. cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or       - has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor (the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters) or to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck (the lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller), and one of the following is true:                           - tumor in the oropharynx is any size and may have spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing); or          -  tumor has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing.                                 - in stage ivb, the tumor:                  - surrounds the carotid artery or has spread to the muscle that opens the jaw, the bone attached to the muscles that move the jaw, nasopharynx, or base of the skull. cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes which can be any size; or       - may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters.                - in stage ivc, the tumor may be any size and has spread beyond the oropharynx to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or liver."
what are the genetic changes related to x-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda ?,"mutations in the trappc2 gene (often called the sedl gene) cause x-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda. the trappc2 gene provides instructions for producing the protein sedlin. the function of sedlin is unclear. researchers believe that sedlin is part of a large molecule called the trafficking protein particle (trapp) complex, which plays a role in the transport of proteins between various cell compartments (organelles). because sedlin is active (expressed) in cells throughout the body; it is unclear why mutations in the trappc2 gene affect only bone growth."
is russell-silver syndrome inherited ?,"is russell-silver syndrome inherited? most cases of russell-silver syndrome (rss) are sporadic (not inherited), which means they occur in people with no family history of rss. less commonly, russell-silver syndrome is inherited. in some families, it appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having one ""copy"" of a genetic change in each cell is enough to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from a parent. in other cases, the change occurs for the first time in an affected person. when a person with a genetic change that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the genetic change. in other families, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. affected people inherit one copy from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). when 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier"
what is (are) spinal cord diseases ?,"your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back. it carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain. it is protected by your vertebrae, which are the bone disks that make up your spine. if you have an accident that damages the vertebrae or other parts of the spine, this can also injure the spinal cord. other spinal cord problems include       -  tumors    -  infections such as meningitis and polio    -  inflammatory diseases    -  autoimmune diseases     -  degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy       symptoms vary but might include pain, numbness, loss of sensation and muscle weakness. these symptoms can occur around the spinal cord, and also in other areas such as your arms and legs. treatments often include medicines and surgery."
what is (are) creating a family health history ?,"in a genetic test, a small sample of blood, saliva, or tissue is taken to examine a person's genes. sometimes, genetic testing can detect diseases that may be preventable or treatable. this type of testing is available for thousands of conditions."
what to do for renal artery stenosis ?,"- renal artery stenosis (ras) is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries. the renal arteries are blood vessels that carry blood to the kidneys from the aortathe main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to arteries throughout the body.  - renovascular hypertension (rvh) is high blood pressure caused by ras.  - about 90 percent of ras is caused by atherosclerosis. most other cases of ras are caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (fmd), which can cause blood vessels to narrow.  - ras often has no symptoms until it becomes severe. the first symptoms of ras are usually either high blood pressure or decreased kidney function, or both, but ras is often overlooked as a cause of high blood pressure.  - people with ras are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease (ckd), coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  - imaging tests used to diagnose ras include duplex ultrasound, catheter angiogram, computerized tomographic angiography (cta) scan, and magnetic resonance angiogram (mra).  - treatment for ras includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery."
what are the treatments for hemolytic anemia ?,"treatments for hemolytic anemia include blood transfusions, medicines, plasmapheresis (plaz-meh-feh-re-sis), surgery, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and lifestyle changes.
                
people who have mild hemolytic anemia may not need treatment, as long as the condition doesn't worsen. people who have severe hemolytic anemia usually need ongoing treatment. severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal if it's not properly treated.
                
goals of treatment
                
the goals of treating hemolytic anemia include:
                
reducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells
                
increasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level
                
treating the underlying cause of the condition
                
treatment will depend on the type, cause, and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have. your doctor also will consider your age, overall health, and medical history.
                
if you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia, it's a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment. if you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia, it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected.
                
blood transfusions
                
blood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia.
                
a blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (iv) line in one of your blood vessels. transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
for more information, go to the health topics blood transfusion article.
                
medicines
                
medicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia (aiha). corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone, can stop your immune system from, or limit its ability to, make antibodies (proteins) against red blood cells.
                
if you don't respond to corticosteroids, your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system. examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine.
                
if you have severe sickle cell anemia, your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea. this medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin. fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have.
                
in people who have sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia.
                
plasmapheresis
                
plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. for this procedure, blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein.
                
the plasma, which contains the antibodies, is separated from the rest of the blood. then, plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body.
                
this treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia don't work.
                
surgery
                
some people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens. the spleen is an organ in the abdomen. a healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells.
                
an enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction.
                
blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
in some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. the red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia.
                
a blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).
                
during the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein. once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
for more information, go to the health topics blood and marrow stem cell transplant article.
                
lifestyle changes
                
if you have aiha with cold-reactive antibodies, try to avoid cold temperatures. this can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. it's very important to protect your fingers, toes, and ears from the cold.
                
to protect yourself, you can:
                
wear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer.
                
wear a hat, scarf, and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather.
                
turn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in air-conditioned spaces.
                
warm up the car before driving in cold weather.
                
people born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia. for example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises)."
what causes fumarase deficiency ?,"what causes fumarase deficiency? mutations in the fh gene cause fumarase deficiency. the fh gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fumarase, which participates in a series of reactions allowing cells to use oxygen and generate energy. mutations in the fh gene disrupt the enzyme's ability to do its job. disruption of the process that generates energy for cells is particularly harmful to cells in the developing brain, thus resulting in the signs and symptoms of fumarase deficiency."
what causes rickets ?,what causes rickets? rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin d. a child might not get enough vitamin d if he or she: has dark skin spends too little time outside has on sunscreen all the time when out of doors doesn't eat foods containing vitamin d because of lactose intolerance or a strict vegetarian diet is breastfed without receiving vitamin d supplements can't make or use vitamin d because of a medical disorder such as celiac disease has an inherited disorder that affects vitamin d levels
is holt-oram syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
how many people are affected by polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy ?,"plosl is a very rare condition. it was first reported in the finnish population, where it has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 2 per million people. this condition has also been diagnosed in more than 100 people in the japanese population. although affected individuals have been reported worldwide, plosl appears to be less common in other countries."

what causes leukonychia totalis ?,"what causes leukonychia totalis? leukonychia totalis (also called total leukonychia) is thought to be due to abnormal keratinization (conversion into keratin) of the nail plate. keratin is a protein that is a major component of the epidermis (outer layer of skin), hair, nails, and horny tissues. the condition is usually inherited, following either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. these inherited forms can be caused by mutations in the plcd1 gene. in some cases, leukonychia occurs in association with other underlying abnormalities or syndromes. conditions that have been reported include palmoplantar keratoderma; certain types of cysts; severe keratosis pilaris; pili torti; hypotrichosis (lack of hair growth); onychorrhexis (brittle nails); koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails); bart-pumphrey syndrome; and buschkell-gorlin syndrome, when it occurs with sebaceous cysts and kidney stones. it has also reportedly been associated with typhoid fever, leprosy, cirrhosis, nail biting, trichinosis, and cytotoxic drugs (drugs that are toxic to cells). in a few cases, the cause of leukonychia is unknown (idiopathic)."
what are the symptoms of childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"signs of childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma include breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes. these and other signs may be caused by childhood non-hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:         - trouble breathing.    - wheezing.    - coughing.    -  high-pitched breathing sounds.    - swelling of the head, neck, upper body, or arms.    - trouble swallowing.    - painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.    - painless lump or swelling in a testicle.     -  fever for no known reason.    - weight loss for no known reason.    - night sweats."
what is (are) movement disorders ?,"imagine if parts of your body moved when you didn't want them to. if you have a movement disorder, you experience these kinds of impaired movement. dyskinesia is abnormal uncontrolled movement and is a common symptom of many movement disorders. tremors are a type of dyskinesia.     nerve diseases cause many movement disorders, such as parkinson's disease. other causes include injuries, autoimmune diseases, infections and certain medicines. many movement disorders are inherited, which means they run in families.    treatment varies by disorder. medicine can cure some disorders. others get better when an underlying disease is treated. often, however, there is no cure. in that case, the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain."
what causes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"what causes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency? succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (ssadh) is caused by mutations in the aldh5a1 gene. this gene provides instructions for producing the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme which is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (gaba). the primary role of gaba is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. a shortage (deficiency) of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase leads to an increase in the amount of gaba and a related molecule called gamma-hydroxybutyrate (ghb) in the body, particularly the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). it is unclear how an increase in gaba and ghb causes developmental delay, seizures, and other signs and symptoms of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency."
what causes eec syndrome ?,"what causes eec syndrome? approximately 90% of individuals with eec syndrome have a causative mutation identified in the tp63 gene. the tp63 gene codes for the p63 protein, which plays a critical role in early development of the ectoderm-the layers of tissue that develop into the skin, hair, teeth, and nails. the p63 protein is additionally thought to play a role in the development of the limbs, facial features, urinary system, and other organs. individuals that have eec syndrome due to a mutation in the tp63 gene are classified as having eec syndrome type 3 (eec3). in approximately 10% of individuals, eec syndrome is caused by a mutation on a region of the q (long) arm of chromosome 7. individuals that have eec syndrome due to a mutation on the q arm of chromosome 7 are classified as having eec syndrome type 1 (eec1). rarely, eec syndrome can be found in individuals that do not have mutations in either the tp63 gene or the q arm of chromosome 7."
what is (are) mitochondrial dna-associated leigh syndrome ?,"mitochondrial dna-associated leigh syndrome is a progressive brain disorder that usually appears in infancy or early childhood. affected children may experience vomiting, seizures, delayed development, muscle weakness, and problems with movement. heart disease, kidney problems, and difficulty breathing can also occur in people with this disorder. mitochondrial dna-associated leigh syndrome is a subtype of leigh syndrome and is caused by changes in mitochondrial dna. mutations in at least 11 mitochondrial genes have been found to cause mtdna-associated leigh syndrome. this condition has an inheritance pattern known as maternal or mitochondrial inheritance. because mitochondria can be passed from one generation to the next only through egg cells (not through sperm cells), only females pass mitochondrial dna-associated leigh syndrome to their children."
how to prevent parasites - zoonotic hookworm ?,"wearing shoes and taking other protective measures to avoid skin contact with sand or soil will prevent infection with zoonotic hookworms. travelers to tropical and subtropical climates, especially where beach exposures are likely, should be advised to wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to prevent direct skin contact with sand or soil. routine veterinary care of dogs and cats, including regular deworming, will reduce environmental contamination with zoonotic hookworm eggs and larvae. prompt disposal of animal feces prevents eggs from hatching and contaminating soil -- which makes it important for control of this parasitic infection."
is pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome inherited ?,pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is generally not inherited but arises from new (de novo) mutations that likely occur in early embryonic development.
how to diagnose atherosclerosis ?,"your doctor will diagnose atherosclerosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.
                
specialists involved
                
if you have atherosclerosis, a primary care doctor, such as an internist or family practitioner, may handle your care. your doctor may recommend other health care specialists if you need expert care, such as:
                
a cardiologist. this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. you may go to a cardiologist if you haveperipheral artery disease(p.a.d.)or coronary microvascular disease (mvd).
                
a vascular specialist. this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood vessel problems. you may go to a vascular specialist if you have p.a.d.
                
a neurologist. this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating nervous system disorders. you may see a neurologist if you've had a stroke due to carotid artery disease.
                
a nephrologist. this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating kidney diseases and conditions. you may go to a nephrologist if you have chronic kidney disease.
                
physical exam
                
during the physical exam, your doctor may listen to your arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-e). your doctor can hear a bruit when placing a stethoscope over an affected artery. a bruit may indicate poor blood flow due to plaque buildup.
                
your doctor also may check to see whether any of your pulses (for example, in the leg or foot) are weak or absent. a weak or absent pulse can be a sign of a blocked artery.
                
diagnostic tests
                
your doctor may recommend one or more tests to diagnose atherosclerosis. these tests also can help your doctor learn the extent of your disease and plan the best treatment.
                
blood tests
                
blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for atherosclerosis.
                
ekg (electrocardiogram)
                
an ekg is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.
                
an ekg can show signs of heart damage caused by chd. the test also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. a chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure.
                
ankle/brachial index
                
this test compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm to see how well your blood is flowing. this test can help diagnose p.a.d.
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. the test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.
                
echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.
                
computed tomography scan
                
a computed tomography (ct) scan creates computer-generated pictures of the heart, brain, or other areas of the body. the test can show hardening and narrowing of large arteries.
                
a cardiac ct scan also can show whether calcium has built up in the walls of the coronary (heart) arteries. this may be an early sign of chd.
                
stress testing
                
during stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. if you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.
                
when your heart is working hard, it needs more blood and oxygen. plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.
                
a stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of chd, such as:
                
abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure
                
shortness of breath or chest pain
                
abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity
                
as part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. these imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. they also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.
                
angiography
                
angiography (an-jee-og-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your arteries. this test can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is.
                
a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. dye that can be seen on an x-ray picture is injected through the catheter into the arteries. by looking at the x-ray picture, your doctor can see the flow of blood through your arteries.
                
other tests
                
other tests are being studied to see whether they can give a better view of plaque buildup in the arteries. examples of these tests include magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and positron emission tomography (pet)."
how many people are affected by familial atrial fibrillation ?,"atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), affecting more than 3 million people in the united states. the risk of developing this irregular heart rhythm increases with age. the incidence of the familial form of atrial fibrillation is unknown; however, recent studies suggest that up to 30 percent of all people with atrial fibrillation may have a history of the condition in their family."
what is (are) miller-dieker syndrome ?,"miller-dieker syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by lissencephaly, typical facial features, and severe neurologic abnormalities. symptoms may include severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, muscle stiffness, weak muscle tone and feeding difficulties. miller-dieker syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17. treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
what is (are) neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy ?,"neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. people with this condition have muscle weakness (myopathy) due to the accumulation of fats in muscle tissue. other features of this condition may include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes). signs and symptoms of neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy vary greatly among affected individuals."
is antiphospholipid syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of antiphospholipid syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families; however, it does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome."
what are the symptoms of factor xiii deficiency ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of factor xiii deficiency? factor xiii deficiency causes internal bleeding. the blood may seep into surrounding soft tissues several days after trauma, even mild trauma such as a bump or bruise. pain and swelling may occur at the injury site prior to bleeding. if the bleeding continues, large cysts may form in the surrounding tissue that may destroy bone and cause peripheral nerve damage, usually in the thigh and buttocks areas. at birth, an infant with factor xiii deficiency may bleed from the umbilical cord, which rarely occurs in other blood clotting disorders. the most serious hemorrhaging that can occur in factor xiii deficiency is in the central nervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord) following mild head trauma. this can occur in about 25 percent of affected individuals. in some cases, hemorrhaging may stop spontaneously without treatment. females with factor xiii deficiency who become pregnant are at high risk for miscarriage if they do not receive appropriate treatment. men with this disorder may be sterile or have extremely low sperm counts. replacing factor xiii in these men does not correct sterility. some of the less frequently seen symptoms are poor wound healing, excessive bleeding from wounds, blood blisters attached to the abdominal wall (retroperitoneal hematomas), and/or blood in the urine (hematuria).some symptoms are seldom or never seen in people with factor xiii deficiency, which may help to distinguish it from other bleeding disorders. these may include excessive blood loss during menstruation, hemorrhages within the eye, gastrointestinal bleeding, arthritis caused by an accumulation of blood in the joints, excessive bleeding after surgery, bleeding from mucous membranes, and/or tiny red spots on the skin. factor xiii deficiency is not generally a threat to those who need surgery. the small amount of factor xiii present in blood transfusions generally prevents bleeding. excessive bleeding from wounds, abrasions, or even spontaneous abortions is not common unless a person with this disorder uses aspirin or similar medications. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for factor xiii deficiency. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal umbilical stump bleeding - autosomal recessive inheritance - bruising susceptibility - congenital onset - epistaxis - intracranial hemorrhage - joint hemorrhage - prolonged bleeding after surgery - reduced factor xiii activity - spontaneous hematomas - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria ?,"the different types of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria result from mutations in several genes. d-2-hga type i is caused by mutations in the d2hgdh gene; type ii is caused by mutations in the idh2 gene. l-2-hga results from mutations in the l2hgdh gene. combined d,l-2-hga is caused by mutations in the slc25a1 gene.  the d2hgdh and l2hgdh genes provide instructions for making enzymes that are found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. the enzymes break down compounds called d-2-hydroxyglutarate and l-2-hydroxyglutarate, respectively, as part of a series of reactions that produce energy for cell activities. mutations in either of these genes lead to a shortage of functional enzyme, which allows d-2-hydroxyglutarate or l-2-hydroxyglutarate to build up in cells. at high levels, these compounds can damage cells and lead to cell death. brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of these compounds, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of d-2-hga type i and l-2-hga primarily involve the brain.  the idh2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme in mitochondria that normally produces a different compound. when the enzyme is altered by mutations, it takes on a new, abnormal function: production of the potentially toxic compound d-2-hydroxyglutarate. the resulting excess of this compound damages brain cells, leading to the signs and symptoms of d-2-hga type ii. it is unclear why an accumulation of d-2-hydroxyglutarate may be associated with cardiomyopathy in some people with this form of the condition.  the slc25a1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports certain molecules, such as citrate, in and out of mitochondria. mutations in the slc25a1 gene reduce the protein's function, which prevents it from carrying out this transport. through processes that are not fully understood, a loss of this transport allows both d-2-hydroxyglutarate and l-2-hydroxyglutarate to build up, which damages brain cells. researchers suspect that an imbalance of other molecules, particularly citrate, also contributes to the severe signs and symptoms of combined d,l-2-hga."
what are the treatments for x-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 ?,"these resources address the diagnosis or management of x-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2:  - gene review: gene review: chondrodysplasia punctata 2, x-linked  - genetic testing registry: chondrodysplasia punctata 2 x-linked dominant   these resources from medlineplus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - diagnostic tests  - drug therapy  - surgery and rehabilitation  - genetic counseling   - palliative care"
what are the treatments for filippi syndrome ?,"how might filippi syndrome be treated? the treatment of filippi syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals who may need to systematically and comprehensively plan an affected child's treatment. these professionals may include pediatricians; physicians who specialize in disorders of the skeleton, joints, muscles, and related tissues (orthopedists); and/or other health care professionals. in some affected individuals, treatment may include surgical repair of certain skeletal or other abnormalities associated with the disorder. the surgical procedures performed will depend upon the severity of the abnormalities, their associated symptoms, and other factors."
is wolfram syndrome inherited ?,"when wolfram syndrome is caused by mutations in the wfs1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. some studies have shown that people who carry one copy of a wfs1 gene mutation are at increased risk of developing individual features of wolfram syndrome or related features, such as type 2 diabetes, hearing loss, or psychiatric illness. however, other studies have found no increased risk in these individuals.  wolfram syndrome caused by mutations in the cisd2 gene is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
what is (are) acanthoma ?,"an acanthoma is a small, reddish bump that usually develops on the skin of an older adult.  there are several types of acanthoma, including ""acantholytic"", ""epidermolytic"", ""clear cell"", and ""melanoacanthoma"".  though most individuals have only one acanthoma, there have been rare reports of individuals who have developed many.  the exact cause of acanthoma is not known; it is sometimes called a benign tumor, and sometimes described as the result of inflammation.  acanthomas are not considered dangerous and do not require treatment, but they may be removed for cosmetic reasons or to relieve any associated symptoms."

what is the outlook for hypotonia ?,"hypotonia can be a life-long condition. in some cases, however, muscle tone improves over time."
who is at risk for adult central nervous system tumors? ?,"having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. there are few known risk factors for brain tumors. the following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors:          - being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma.    -  infection with the epstein-barr virus, having aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary cns lymphoma. (see the pdq summary on primary cns lymphoma for more information.)    - having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors:               -  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) or 2 (nf2).      -  von hippel-lindau disease.      -  tuberous sclerosis.      -  li-fraumeni syndrome.      - turcot syndrome type 1 or 2.      -  nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome."
how many people are affected by n-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency ?,"n-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency is a very rare disorder. only a few cases have been reported worldwide, and the overall incidence is unknown."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for plasma cell neoplasms (including multiple myeloma) ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     new combinations of therapies     clinical trials are studying different combinations of biologic therapy, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, and drugs. new treatment regimens using thalidomide or lenalidomide are also being studied.
                
                
                    supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.
                    this therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life. supportive care is given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     supportive care may include the following:          -  plasmapheresis: if the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and interferes with circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. in this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. the patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. the normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.     -  high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant: if amyloidosis occurs, treatment may include high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells.    -  biologic therapy: biologic therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  targeted therapy: targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  radiation therapy: radiation therapy is given for bone lesions of the spine.    -  chemotherapy: chemotherapy is given to reduce back pain from osteoporosis or compression fractures of the spine.    -  bisphosphonate therapy: bisphosphonate therapy is given to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain. see the following pdq summaries for more information on bisphosphonates and problems related to their use:               - cancer pain      - oral complications of chemotherapy and head/neck radiation
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what are the stages of melanoma ?,"key points

                    the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the skin or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy : procedures in which a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. the substance or dye flows through lymph ducts to the sentinel node or nodes (the first lymph node or nodes where cancer cells are likely to spread). the surgeon removes only the nodes with the radioactive substance or dye. a pathologist views a sample of tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. if no cancer cells are found, it may not be necessary to remove more nodes.     -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. for melanoma, pictures may be taken of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.    -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. for melanoma, the blood is checked for an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). ldh levels that are higher than normal may be a sign of melanoma.        the results of these tests are viewed together with the results of the tumor biopsy to find out the stage of the melanoma.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if melanoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually melanoma cells. the disease is metastatic melanoma, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    the method used to stage melanoma is based mainly on the thickness of the tumor and whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
                    the staging of melanoma depends on the following:         - the thickness of the tumor. the thickness is described using the breslow scale.    -  whether the tumor is ulcerated (has broken through the skin).    - whether the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes and if the lymph nodes are joined together (matted).    - whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for melanoma:
                    stage 0 (melanoma in situ)      in stage 0, abnormal melanocytes are found in the epidermis. these abnormal melanocytes may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called melanoma in situ.        stage i      in stage i, cancer has formed. stage i is divided into stages ia and ib.            -  stage ia: in stage ia, the tumor is not more than 1 millimeter thick, with no ulceration.     -  stage ib: in stage ib, the tumor is either:                   -  not more than 1 millimeter thick and it has ulceration; or       -  more than 1 but not more than 2 millimeters thick, with no ulceration.                          stage ii       stage ii is divided into stages iia, iib, and iic.            -  stage iia: in stage iia, the tumor is either:                   - more than 1 but not more than 2 millimeters thick, with ulceration; or       - more than 2 but not more than 4 millimeters thick, with no ulceration.                  -  stage iib: in stage iib, the tumor is either:                   - more than 2 but not more than 4 millimeters thick, with ulceration; or       - more than 4 millimeters thick, with no ulceration.                 -  stage iic: in stage iic, the tumor is more than 4 millimeters thick, with ulceration.               stage iii      in stage iii, the tumor may be any thickness, with or without ulceration. one or more of the following is true:             -  cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes.     - lymph nodes are joined together (matted).     - cancer is in a lymph vessel between the primary tumor and nearby lymph nodes. the cancer is more than 2 centimeters away from the primary tumor.     - very small tumors are found on or under the skin, not more than 2 centimeters away from the primary tumor.              stage iv      in stage iv, the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lung, liver, brain, bone, soft tissue, or gastrointestinal (gi) tract. cancer may have spread to places in the skin far away from where it first started."
what is (are) dominant optic atrophy ?,"dominant optic atrophy (doa) is an inherited optic nerve disorder characterized by degeneration of the optic nerves. it typically starts during the first decade of life. affected people usually develop moderate visual loss and color vision defects. the severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. about 20% of people with doa have non-ocular features, such as sensorineural hearing loss; myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs). these cases may be referred to as 'doa plus.' doa is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a mutation in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified. there is currently no way to prevent or cure doa, but affected people may benefit from low vision aids."
what is (are) campomelic dysplasia ?,"campomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. this condition is often life-threatening in the newborn period.  the term ""campomelic"" comes from the greek words for ""bent limb."" affected individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and occasionally, bowing in the arms. bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. people with campomelic dysplasia usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck, and inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet). these skeletal abnormalities begin developing before birth and can often be seen on ultrasound. when affected individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.  many people with campomelic dysplasia have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). approximately 75 percent of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,xy) have ambiguous genitalia or normal female genitalia. internal reproductive organs may not correspond with the external genitalia; the internal organs can be male (testes), female (ovaries), or a combination of the two. for example, an individual with female external genitalia may have testes or a combination of testes and ovaries.  affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin, prominent eyes, and a flat face. they also have a large head compared to their body size. a particular group of physical features, called pierre robin sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. pierre robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). people with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. this abnormality, called laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the airway and causes difficulty breathing. laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants with campomelic dysplasia.  only a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. as these individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. people with campomelic dysplasia may also have short stature and hearing loss."
what to do for hemochromatosis ?,"- hemochromatosis is the most common form of iron overload disease. too much iron in the body causes hemochromatosis.  - inherited genetic defects cause primary hemochromatosis.  - primary hemochromatosis mainly affects caucasians of northern european descent.  - a person with hemochromatosis may notice one or more of the following symptoms: joint pain; fatigue, or feeling tired; unexplained weight loss; abnormal bronze or gray skin color; abdominal pain; and loss of sex drive. not everyone with hemochromatosis will develop these symptoms.  - without treatment, iron may build up in the organs and cause complications, including cirrhosis, diabetes, irregular heart rhythms or weakening of the heart muscle, arthritis, and erectile dysfunction.  - if a health care provider diagnoses and treats the iron overload caused by hemochromatosis before organ damage has occurred, a person can live a normal, healthy life.  - experts recommend testing for hemochromatosis in people who have symptoms, complications, or a family history of the disease.  - health care providers treat hemochromatosis by drawing blood. this process is called phlebotomy."
is schindler disease type 1 inherited ?,"how is schindler disease type 1 inherited? schindler disease type 1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. this means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically so not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what are the genetic changes related to infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ?,"mutations in the ppt1 gene cause most cases of infantile ncl. the ppt1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. this enzyme is active in cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 removes certain fats called long-chain fatty acids from proteins, which probably helps break down the proteins. palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 is also thought to be involved in a variety of other cell functions.  ppt1 gene mutations that cause infantile ncl decrease the production or function of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. a shortage of functional enzyme impairs the removal of fatty acids from proteins. in the lysosomes, these fats and proteins accumulate as fatty substances called lipopigments. these accumulations occur in cells throughout the body, but nerve cells in the brain seem to be particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by buildup of lipopigments and the loss of enzyme function. the progressive death of cells, especially in the brain, leads to the signs and symptoms of infantile ncl."
what to do for overview of kidney disease in children ?,"for children with ckd, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. staying healthy with ckd requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet:
                
- protein. children with ckd should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. the health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. foods with protein include      - eggs    - milk    - cheese    - chicken    - fish    - red meats    - beans    - yogurt    - cottage cheese    - sodium. the amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. the health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. foods high in sodium include      - canned foods    - some frozen foods    - most processed foods    - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers    - potassium. potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with ckd, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. the health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. low-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - apples    - cranberries    - strawberries    - blueberries    - raspberries    - pineapple    - cabbage    - boiled cauliflower    - mustard greens    - uncooked broccoli    - high-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - oranges    - melons    - apricots    - bananas    - potatoes    - tomatoes    - sweet potatoes    - cooked spinach    - cooked broccoli    - phosphorus. children with ckd need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. as ckd progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. foods with low levels of phosphorus include      - liquid nondairy creamer    - green beans    - popcorn    - unprocessed meats from a butcher    - lemon-lime soda    - root beer    - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes    - rice and corn cereals    - egg white    - sorbet    - fluids. early in ckd, a childs damaged kidneys may produce either too much or too little urine, which can lead to swelling or dehydration. as ckd progresses, children may need to limit fluid intake. the health care provider will tell the child and parents or guardians the goal for fluid intake.

what are the stages of skin cancer ?,"key points
                    - after nonmelanoma skin cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer depends on whether the tumor has certain ""high-risk"" features and if the tumor is on the eyelid.    - the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid:         - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i stage i nonmelanoma skin cancer. the tumor is no more than 2 centimeters.     - stage ii stage ii nonmelanoma skin cancer. the tumor is more than 2 centimeters wide.     - stage iii     - stage iv        - the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer on the eyelid:         - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i      - stage ii     - stage iii     - stage iv        - treatment is based on the type of nonmelanoma skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed:         - basal cell carcinoma     - squamous cell carcinoma     - actinic keratosis
                
                
                    after nonmelanoma skin cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the skin or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   lymph node biopsy : for squamous cell carcinoma, the lymph nodes may be removed and checked to see if cancer has spread to them.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if skin cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually skin cancer cells. the disease is metastatic skin cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer depends on whether the tumor has certain ""high-risk"" features and if the tumor is on the eyelid.
                    staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is on the eyelid is different from staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that affects other parts of the body.     the following are high-risk features for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid:         - the tumor is thicker than 2 millimeters.    - the tumor is described as clark level iv (has spread into the lower layer of the dermis) or clark level v (has spread into the layer of fat below the skin).    - the tumor has grown and spread along nerve pathways.    - the tumor began on an ear or on a lip that has hair on it.    - the tumor has cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid:
                    stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the squamous cell or basal cell layer of the epidermis (topmost layer of the skin). these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        stage i     in stage i, cancer has formed. the tumor is not larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point and may have one high-risk feature.       stage ii     in stage ii, the tumor is either:            - larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point; or     - any size and has two or more high-risk features.              stage iii    in stage iii:            - the tumor has spread to the jaw, eye socket, or side of the skull. cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor. the lymph node is not larger than 3 centimeters.              or              - cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor. the lymph node is not larger than 3 centimeters and one of the following is true:                  - the tumor is not larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point and may have one high-risk feature; or       - the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point; or       - the tumor is any size and has two or more high-risk features.                          stage iv    in stage iv, one of the following is true:            - the tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw, eye socket, or side of the skull. cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor and the affected node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one or both sides of the body and the affected nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; or     - the tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw, eye socket, skull, spine, or ribs. cancer has spread to one lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters; or      - the tumor is any size and has spread to the base of the skull, spine, or ribs. cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes; or     - cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer on the eyelid:
                    stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the epidermis (topmost layer of the skin). these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       stage i      stage i is divided into stages ia, ib, and ic.            -  stage ia: the tumor is 5 millimeters or smaller and has not spread to the connective tissue of the eyelid or to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are.      -  stage ib: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters or has spread to the connective tissue of the eyelid, or to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are.     -  stage ic: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters or has spread through the full thickness of the eyelid.              stage ii    in stage ii, one of the following is true:            - the tumor is larger than 20 millimeters.     - the tumor has spread to nearby parts of the eye or eye socket.     - the tumor has spread to spaces around the nerves in the eyelid.              stage iii     stage iii is divided into stages iiia, iiib, and iiic.            -  stage iiia: to remove all of the tumor, the whole eye and part of the optic nerve must be removed. the bone, muscles, fat, and connective tissue around the eye may also be removed.     -  stage iiib: the tumor may be anywhere in or near the eye and has spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  stage iiic: the tumor has spread to structures around the eye or in the face, or to the brain, and cannot be removed in surgery.              stage iv    the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body.
                
                
                    treatment is based on the type of nonmelanoma skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed:
                    basal cell carcinoma      basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. it usually occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, most often the nose. often this cancer appears as a raised bump that looks smooth and pearly. another type looks like a scar and is flat and firm and may be white, yellow, or waxy. basal cell carcinoma may spread to tissues around the cancer, but it usually does not spread to other parts of the body.       squamous cell carcinoma      squamous cell carcinoma occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands. squamous cell carcinoma may also appear on areas of the skin that have been burned or exposed to chemicals or radiation. often this cancer appears as a firm red bump. the tumor may feel scaly, bleed, or form a crust. squamous cell tumors may spread to nearby lymph nodes. squamous cell carcinoma that has not spread can usually be cured.       actinic keratosis     actinic keratosis is a skin condition that is not cancer, but sometimes changes into squamous cell carcinoma. it usually occurs in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, the back of the hands, and the lower lip. it looks like rough, red, pink, or brown scaly patches on the skin that may be flat or raised, or the lower lip cracks and peels and is not helped by lip balm or petroleum jelly."

what is (are) postpartum depression ?,"many women have the baby blues after childbirth. if you have the baby blues, you may have mood swings, feel sad, anxious or overwhelmed, have crying spells, lose your appetite, or have trouble sleeping. the baby blues most often go away within a few days or a week. the symptoms are not severe and do not need treatment.    the symptoms of postpartum depression last longer and are more severe. you may also feel hopeless and worthless, and lose interest in the baby. you may have thoughts of hurting yourself or the baby. very rarely, new mothers develop something even more serious. they may have hallucinations or try to hurt themselves or the baby. they need to get treatment right away, often in the hospital.    postpartum depression can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth. the cause is not known. hormonal and physical changes after birth and the stress of caring for a new baby may play a role. women who have had depression are at higher risk.    if you think you have postpartum depression, tell your health care provider. medicines, including antidepressants and talk therapy can help you get well.    dept. of health and human services office on women's health"
what are the treatments for chordoma ?,"how might a chordoma be treated? unfortunately, because chordomas are quite rare, the best treatment for these tumors has yet to be determined.  the current treatment for chordoma of the clivus often begins with surgery (resection) to remove as much of the tumor as possible.  the extent of surgery, or the amount of tumor that may be removed, depends on the location of the tumor and how close it is to critical structures in the brain.  surgery is followed by radiation therapy to destroy any cancer cells that may remain after surgery.  several studies have suggested that proton beam radiation or combined proton/photon radiation may be more effect than conventional photon radiation therapy for treating chordomas of the skull base because proton radiation may allow for a greater dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor without damaging the surrounding normal tissues.  approximately 60-70% of individuals treated with combined surgery and radiation therapy remained tumor-free for at least five years."
how to diagnose prostate cancer ?,"tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   digital rectal exam (dre): an exam of the rectum. the doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas.     -   prostate-specific antigen (psa) test : a test that measures the level of psa in the blood. psa is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. psa levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or bph (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).    -   transrectal ultrasound : a procedure in which a probe that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. the probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. transrectal ultrasound may be used during a biopsy procedure.    -  transrectal magnetic resonance imaging (mri): a procedure that uses a strong magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. a probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. this helps the mri machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. a transrectal mri is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -  biopsy: the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. the pathologist will check the tissue sample to see if there are cancer cells and find out the gleason score. the gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how likely it is that a tumor will spread. the lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread.  a transrectal biopsy is used to diagnose prostate cancer. a transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. this procedure is usually done using transrectal ultrasound to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells."
what is (are) anal cancer ?,"the anus is where stool leaves your body when you go to the bathroom. it is made up of your outer layers of skin and the end of your large intestine. anal cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the anus.    anal cancer is rare. it is more common in smokers and people over 50. you are also at higher risk if you have hpv, have anal sex, or have many sexual partners.    symptoms include bleeding, pain, or lumps in the anal area. anal itching and discharge can also be signs of anal cancer.    doctors use tests that examine the anus to diagnose anal cancer. they include a physical exam, endoscopy, ultrasound, and biopsy.    treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery.    nih: national cancer institute"
what is (are) periventricular heterotopia ?,"periventricular heterotopia is a condition in which nerve cells (neurons) do not migrate properly during the early development of the fetal brain, from about the 6th week to the 24th week of pregnancy. heterotopia means ""out of place."" in normal brain development, neurons form in the periventricular region, located around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain. the neurons then migrate outward to form the exterior of the brain (cerebral cortex) in six onion-like layers. in periventricular heterotopia, some neurons fail to migrate to their proper position and form clumps around the ventricles.  periventricular heterotopia usually becomes evident when seizures first appear, often during the teenage years. the nodules around the ventricles are then typically discovered when magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies are done. affected individuals usually have normal intelligence, although some have mild intellectual disability. difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia) has been reported in some people with periventricular heterotopia.  less commonly, individuals with periventricular heterotopia may have more severe brain malformations, small head size (microcephaly), developmental delays, recurrent infections, blood vessel abnormalities, or other problems. periventricular heterotopia may also occur in association with other conditions such as ehlers-danlos syndrome, which results in extremely flexible joints, skin that stretches easily, and fragile blood vessels."
how to diagnose adult hodgkin lymphoma ?,"tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult hodgkin lymphoma. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - the portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.             -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   sedimentation rate : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. the sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. a higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma or another condition. also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or esr.    -  lymph node biopsy : the removal of all or part of a lymph node. one of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lymph node.       -  incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node.      -  core biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle.          a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially reed-sternberg cells. reed-sternberg cells are common in classical hodgkin lymphoma.  the following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  immunophenotyping : a laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system."
how to diagnose amelogenesis imperfecta ?,"how is amelogenesis imperfecta diagnosed? a dentist can identify and diagnose amelogenesis imperfecta on the basis of the patient's family history and the signs and symptoms present in the affected individual. extraoral x-rays (x-rays taken outside the mouth) can reveal the presence of teeth that never erupted o that were absorbed. intraoral x-rays (x-rays taken inside the mouth) show contrast between the enamel and dentin in cases in which mineralization is affected. genetic testing is available for the genes amelx, enam, and mmp20. you can visit the genetic testing registry to locate laboratories performing genetic testing for these genes. the american academy of pediatric dentistry is a source of information to find a pediatric dentist. the national dental association can also assist people in locating a dentist."
what is (are) nijmegen breakage syndrome ?,"nijmegen breakage syndrome is a condition characterized by short stature, an unusually small head size (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, recurrent respiratory tract infections, an increased risk of cancer, intellectual disability, and other health problems.  people with this condition typically grow slowly during infancy and early childhood. after this period of slow growth, affected individuals grow at a normal rate but remain shorter than their peers. microcephaly is apparent from birth in the majority of affected individuals. the head does not grow at the same rate as the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). individuals with nijmegen breakage syndrome have distinctive facial features that include a sloping forehead, a prominent nose, large ears, a small jaw, and outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures). these facial features typically become apparent by age 3.  people with nijmegen breakage syndrome have a malfunctioning immune system (immunodeficiency) with abnormally low levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin g (igg) and immunoglobulin a (iga). affected individuals also have a shortage of immune system cells called t cells. the immune system abnormalities increase susceptibility to recurrent infections, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and other infections affecting the upper respiratory tract and lungs.  individuals with nijmegen breakage syndrome have an increased risk of developing cancer, most commonly a cancer of immune system cells called non-hodgkin lymphoma. about half of individuals with nijmegen breakage syndrome develop non-hodgkin lymphoma, usually before age 15. other cancers seen in people with nijmegen breakage syndrome include brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and glioma, and a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma. people with nijmegen breakage syndrome are 50 times more likely to develop cancer than people without this condition.  intellectual development is normal in most people with this condition for the first year or two of life, but then development becomes delayed. skills decline over time, and most affected children and adults have mild to moderate intellectual disability.  most affected woman have premature ovarian failure and do not begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea) or have infrequent menstrual periods. most women with nijmegen breakage syndrome are unable to have biological children (infertile)."
what are the genetic changes related to 16p11.2 deletion syndrome ?,"people with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 600,000 dna building blocks (base pairs), also written as 600 kilobases (kb), at position p11.2 on chromosome 16. this deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell. the 600 kb region contains more than 25 genes, and in many cases little is known about their function. researchers are working to determine how the missing genes contribute to the features of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome."
what is (are) chromosome 6q deletion ?,"chromosome 6q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 6. the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. features that often occur in people with chromosome 6q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."

what is (are) mantle cell lymphoma ?,"mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) belongs to a group of diseases known as  non-hodgkins lymphomas (nhl), which are cancers that affect the the lymphatic system (part of the immune system). mcl accounts for 6% of all non-hodgkin lymphomas and is mostly found in males during their early 60s. lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that make up the lymphatic system. there are two main types: b-lymphocytes (b-cells) and t-lymphocytes (t-cells). mantel cell lymphoma is a b-cell lymphoma that develops from cancerous b-cells within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone. although mantle cell lymphomas are slow-growing cancers, at the time of diagnosis, they are usually widespread in the lymph nodes and require intensive treatment because they can become lethal within a short period of time."
what is (are) transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ?,"transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (tses), also known as prion diseases, are a group of rare degenerative brain disorders characterized by tiny holes that give the brain a ""spongy"" appearance. these holes can be seen when brain tissue is viewed under a microscope.
                
creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) is the most well-known of the human tses. it is a rare type of dementia that affects about one in every one million people each year. other human tses include kuru, fatal familial insomnia (ffi), and gerstmann-straussler-scheinker disease (gss). kuru was identified in people of an isolated tribe in papua new guinea and has now almost disappeared. ffi and gss are extremely rare hereditary diseases, found in just a few families around the world. a new type of cjd, called variant cjd (vcjd), was first described in 1996 and has been found in great britain and several other european countries. the initial symptoms of vcjd are different from those of classic cjd and the disorder typically occurs in younger patients. research suggests that vcjd may have resulted from human consumption of beef from cattle with a tse disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), also known as ""mad cow disease."" other tses found in animals include scrapie, which affects sheep and goats; chronic wasting disease, which affects elk and deer; and transmissible mink encephalopathy. in a few rare cases, tses have occurred in other mammals such as zoo animals. these cases are probably caused by contaminated feed. cjd and other tses also can be transmitted experimentally to mice and other animals in the laboratory.
                
research suggests that tses are caused by an abnormal version of a protein called a prion (prion is short for proteinaceous infectious particle). prion proteins occur in both a normal form, which is a harmless protein found in the body's cells, and in an infectious form, which causes disease. the harmless and infectious forms of the prion protein are nearly identical, but the infectious form takes on a different folded shape from the normal protein.
                
human tses can occur three ways: sporadically; as hereditary diseases; or through transmission from infected individuals. sporadic tses may develop because some of a person's normal prions spontaneously change into the infectious form of the protein and then alter the prions in other cells in a chain reaction. inherited cases arise from a change, or mutation, in the prion protein gene that causes the prions to be shaped in an abnormal way. this genetic change may be transmitted to an individual's offspring. transmission of tses from infected individuals is relatively rare. tses cannot be transmitted through the air or through touching or most other forms of casual contact. however, they may be transmitted through contact with infected tissue, body fluids, or contaminated medical instruments. normal sterilization procedures such as boiling or irradiating materials do not prevent transmission of tses.
                
symptoms of tses vary, but they commonly include personality changes, psychiatric problems such as depression, lack of coordination, and/or an unsteady gait. patients also may experience involuntary jerking movements called myoclonus, unusual sensations, insomnia, confusion, or memory problems. in the later stages of the disease, patients have severe mental impairment and lose the ability to move or speak."
what are the symptoms of hemochromatosis type 4 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis type 4? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for hemochromatosis type 4. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of iron homeostasis 90% arthralgia 90% generalized hyperpigmentation 90% joint swelling 90% limitation of joint mobility 90% abdominal pain 50% hepatic steatosis 50% cirrhosis 7.5% congenital hepatic fibrosis 7.5% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) your guide to diabetes: type 1 and type 2 ?,"prediabetes is when the amount of glucose in your blood is above normal yet not high enough to be called diabetes. with prediabetes, your chances of getting type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke are higher. with some weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. you can even return to normal glucose levels, possibly without taking any medicines."
what are the symptoms of heart attack ?,"symptoms can vary not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on tv or in the movies. the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack aren't the same for everyone. many heart attacks start slowly as mild pain or discomfort. some people don't have symptoms at all. heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. however, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. the more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack if you have a second heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same as the first heart attack. here are common signs and symptoms of a heart attack. chest pain or discomfort the most common symptom of heart attack is chest pain or discomfort. chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. the discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. it can be mild or severe. heart attack pain can sometimes feel like indigestion or heartburn. all chest pain should be checked by a doctor. other upper body discomfort discomfort can also occur in other areas of the upper body, including pain or numbness in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach. shortness of breath shortness of breath often happens along with, or before chest discomfort. other symptoms other symptoms may include - breaking out in a cold sweat   - having nausea and vomiting   - feeling light-headed or dizzy   - fainting   - sleep problems   - fatigue   - lack of energy.  breaking out in a cold sweat having nausea and vomiting feeling light-headed or dizzy fainting sleep problems fatigue lack of energy. angina or a heart attack? angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. angina occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they're active. angina symptoms can be very similar to heart attack symptoms. angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. if you think you may be having a heart attack, or if your angina pain does not go away as usual when you take your angina medication as directed, call 9-1-1 for help. you can begin to receive life saving treatment in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room."
is desmosterolosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to prekallikrein deficiency ?,"prekallikrein deficiency is caused by mutations in the klkb1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein. this protein, when converted to an active form called plasma kallikrein in the blood, is involved in the early stages of blood clotting. plasma kallikrein plays a role in a process called the intrinsic coagulation pathway (also called the contact activation pathway). this pathway turns on (activates) proteins that are needed later in the clotting process. blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.  the klkb1 gene mutations that cause prekallikrein deficiency reduce or eliminate functional plasma kallikrein, which likely impairs the intrinsic coagulation pathway. researchers suggest that this lack (deficiency) of functional plasma kallikrein protein does not generally cause any symptoms because another process called the extrinsic coagulation pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) can compensate for the impaired intrinsic coagulation pathway."
what causes hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum ?,what causes hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (h-abc)? hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (h-abc) is caused by a mutation in the tubb4a gene. the mutation usually occurs for the first time in a family as a result of a new mutation in the affected individual. the mutation is rarely inherited from a parent.
what is (are) frank ter haar syndrome ?,"frank-ter haar syndrome is a rare inherited condition characterized by multiple skeletal abnormalities, developmental delay, and characteristic facial features (unusually large cornea, flattened back of the head, wide fontanels, prominent forehead, widely spaced eyes, prominent eyes, full cheeks, and small chin). less than 30 cases have been reported worldwide. protruding ears, prominent coccyx bone (or tail bone), and congenital heart defects are also frequently present. this condition is caused by mutations in the sh3pxd2b gene and is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
how many people are affected by sialuria ?,"fewer than 10 people worldwide have been diagnosed with sialuria. there are probably more people with the disorder who have not been diagnosed, as sialuria can be difficult to detect because of its variable features."
what is (are) kidney failure: choosing a treatment that's right for you ?,"purpose of hemodialysis
                
the purpose of hemodialysis is to filter your blood. this type of dialysis uses a machine to remove harmful wastes and extra fluid, as your kidneys did when they were healthy. hemodialysis helps control blood pressure and balance important minerals, such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and bicarbonate, in your blood. hemodialysis is not a cure for kidney failure; however, it can help you feel better and live longer.
                
how hemodialysis works
                
before you can begin dialysis, a surgeon will create a vascular access, usually in your arm. a vascular access lets high volumes of blood flow continuously during hemodialysis treatments to filter the largest possible amounts of blood per treatment.
                
hemodialysis uses a machine to move your blood through a filter, called a dialyzer, outside your body. a pump on the hemodialysis machine draws your blood through a needle into a tube, a few ounces at a time. your blood then travels through the tube, which takes it to the dialyzer. inside the dialyzer, your blood flows through thin fibers that filter out wastes and extra fluid. after the dialyzer filters your blood, another tube carries your blood back to your body. you can do hemodialysis at a dialysis center or in your home.
                
hemodialysis can replace part of your kidney function. you will also need dietary changes, medicines, and limits on water and other liquids you drink and get from food. your dietary changes, the number of medicines you need, and limits on liquid will depend on where you receive your treatmentsat a dialysis center or at homeand how often you receive treatmentsthree or more times a week.
                
pros and cons of hemodialysis
                
the pros and cons of hemodialysis differ for each person. what may be bad for one person may be good for another. following is a list of the general pros and cons of dialysis center and home hemodialysis.
                
dialysis center hemodialysis
                
pros
                
- dialysis centers are widely available.  - trained health care providers are with you at all times and help administer the treatment.  - you can get to know other people with kidney failure who also need hemodialysis.  - you dont have to have a trained partner or keep equipment in your home.
                
cons
                
- the center arranges everyones treatments and allows few exceptions to the schedule.  - you need to travel to the center for treatment.  - this treatment has the strictest diet and limits on liquids because the longer time between treatments means wastes and extra fluid can build up in your body.  - you may have more frequent ups and downs in how you feel from day to day because of the longer time between sessions.  - feeling better after a treatment may take a few hours.
                
home hemodialysis
                
pros
                
- you can do the treatment at the times you choose; however, you should follow your doctors orders about how many times a week you need treatment.  - you dont have to travel to a dialysis center.  - you gain a sense of control over your treatment.  - you will have fewer ups and downs in how you feel from day to day because of more frequent sessions.  - you can do your treatments at times that will let you work outside the home.  - you will have a more manageable diet and fewer limits on liquids because the shorter time between sessions prevents the buildup of wastes and extra fluid.  - you can take along a hemodialysis machine when traveling.  - you can spend more time with your loved ones because you dont have to go to the dialysis center three times a week.
                
cons
                
- not all dialysis centers offer home hemodialysis training and support.  - you and a family member or friend will have to set aside a week or more at the beginning for training.  - helping with treatments may be stressful for your family or friend.  - you need space for storing the hemodialysis machine and supplies at home.  - you will need to learn to put dialysis needles into your vascular access.  - medicare and private insurance companies may limit the number of treatments they will pay for when you use home hemodialysis. few people can afford the costs for additional treatments.
                
questions to ask my doctor
                
you may want to ask your doctor these questions:
                
- is hemodialysis the best treatment choice for me? why?   - if im treated at a dialysis center, can i go to the center of my choice?  - what should i look for in a dialysis center?  - will my kidney doctor see me at the dialysis center?  - what does hemodialysis feel like?  - how will hemodialysis affect my ____ [blood pressure, diabetes, other conditions]?  - is home hemodialysis available in my area? what type of training will i need? who will train my partner and me?  - will i be able to keep working? can i have treatments at night? will i be able to care for my children?  - how much should i exercise?   - whom do i contact if i have problems?  - who will be on my health care team? how can the members of my health care team help me?  - if i do home hemodialysis, will my insurance pay for more than three sessions a week?  - with whom can i talk about finances, sex, or family concerns?   - how/where can i talk with other people who have faced this decision?
                
more information about hemodialysis and home hemodialysis is provided in the niddk health topics, treatment methods for kidney failure: hemodialysis and home hemodialysis. see also the kidney failure treatment comparison chart in this booklet, which compares hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation."
what is (are) doors syndrome ?,"doors syndrome is a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). ""doors"" is an abbreviation for the major features of the disorder including deafness; short or absent nails (onychodystrophy); short fingers and toes (osteodystrophy); developmental delay and intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation); and seizures. some people with doors syndrome do not have all of these features.  most people with doors syndrome have profound hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ears (sensorineural deafness). developmental delay and intellectual disability are also often severe in this disorder.  the nail abnormalities affect both the hands and the feet in doors syndrome. impaired growth of the bones at the tips of the fingers and toes (hypoplastic terminal phalanges) account for the short fingers and toes characteristic of this disorder. some affected individuals also have an extra bone and joint in their thumbs, causing the thumbs to look more like the other fingers (triphalangeal thumbs).  the seizures that occur in people with doors syndrome usually start in infancy. the most common seizures in people with this condition are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures), which cause muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. affected individuals may also have other types of seizures, including partial seizures, which affect only one area of the brain and do not cause a loss of consciousness; absence seizures, which cause loss of consciousness for a short period that appears as a staring spell; or myoclonic seizures, which cause rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks. in some affected individuals the seizures increase in frequency and become more severe and difficult to control, and a potentially life-threatening prolonged seizure (status epilepticus) can occur.  other features that can occur in people with doors syndrome include an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and facial differences, most commonly a wide, bulbous nose. a narrow or high arched roof of the mouth (palate), broadening of the ridges in the upper and lower jaw that contain the sockets of the teeth (alveolar ridges), or shortening of the membrane between the floor of the mouth and the tongue (frenulum) have also been observed in some affected individuals. people with doors syndrome may also have dental abnormalities, structural abnormalities of the heart or urinary tract, and abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). most affected individuals also have higher-than-normal levels of a substance called 2-oxoglutaric acid in their urine; these levels can fluctuate between normal and elevated."
what is (are) sporadic hemiplegic migraine ?,"sporadic hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine headache. migraines typically cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head. some people with migraines also experience nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. these recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma. each headache may last from a few hours to a few days.  in sporadic hemiplegic migraine and some other types of migraine, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura occurs before onset of the headache. an aura commonly includes temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. in people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). additional features of an aura can include difficulty with speech, confusion, and drowsiness. an aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour.  some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine experience unusually severe migraine episodes. these episodes can include fever, prolonged weakness, seizures, and coma. although most people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. some affected individuals develop mild but permanent difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. mild to severe intellectual disability has been reported in some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine."
what are the symptoms of hypoglycemia ?,"hypoglycemia causes symptoms such as
                
- hunger  - shakiness  - nervousness  - sweating  - dizziness or light-headedness  - sleepiness  - confusion  - difficulty speaking  - anxiety  - weakness
                
hypoglycemia can also happen during sleep. some signs of hypoglycemia during sleep include
                
- crying out or having nightmares  - finding pajamas or sheets damp from perspiration  - feeling tired, irritable, or confused after waking up"
what are the genetic changes related to russell-silver syndrome ?,"the genetic causes of russell-silver syndrome are complex. the disorder often results from the abnormal regulation of certain genes that control growth. research has focused on genes located in particular regions of chromosome 7 and chromosome 11.  people normally inherit one copy of each chromosome from their mother and one copy from their father. for most genes, both copies are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in cells. for some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy) is expressed. for other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is expressed. these parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. both chromosome 7 and chromosome 11 contain groups of genes that normally undergo genomic imprinting. abnormalities involving these genes appear to be responsible for many cases of russell-silver syndrome.  researchers suspect that at least one third of all cases of russell-silver syndrome result from changes in a process called methylation. methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of dna. in genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. russell-silver syndrome has been associated with changes in methylation involving the h19 and igf2 genes, which are located near one another on chromosome 11. these genes are thought to be involved in directing normal growth. a loss of methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to slow growth and the other characteristic features of this disorder.  abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 7 also cause russell-silver syndrome. in 7 percent to 10 percent of cases, people inherit both copies of chromosome 7 from their mother instead of one copy from each parent. this phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy (upd). maternal upd causes people to have two active copies of maternally expressed imprinted genes rather than one active copy from the mother and one inactive copy from the father. these individuals do not have a paternal copy of chromosome 7 and therefore do not have any copies of genes that are active only on the paternal copy. in cases of russell-silver syndrome caused by maternal upd, an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 7 underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  in at least 40 percent of people with russell-silver syndrome, the cause of the condition is unknown. it is possible that changes in chromosomes other than 7 and 11 may play a role. researchers are working to identify additional genetic changes that underlie this disorder."
what is (are) bradyopsia ?,"bradyopsia is a rare condition that affects vision. the term ""bradyopsia"" is from the greek words for slow vision. in affected individuals, the eyes adapt more slowly than usual to changing light conditions. for example, people with this condition are blinded for several seconds when going from a dark environment into a bright one, such as when walking out of a darkened movie theater into daylight. their eyes also have trouble adapting from bright light to dark conditions, such as when driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day.  some people with bradyopsia also have difficulty seeing some moving objects, particularly small objects moving against a bright background. as a result, they often have trouble watching or participating in sports with a ball, such as soccer or tennis. people with bradyopsia can have reduced sharpness (acuity) of vision, although acuity may depend on the conditions under which vision is tested. visual acuity may appear to be severely affected if it is tested under bright lights, but it can be near normal if tested in a dim environment. the ability to see colors and distinguish between them is normal.  the vision problems associated with bradyopsia become apparent in early childhood. they are usually stable, which means they do not worsen over time."
is familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. almost everyone with a mutation in the pnkd gene will develop familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia. in all reported cases, an affected person has inherited the mutation from one parent."
is coats plus syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the symptoms of benign rolandic epilepsy (bre) ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of benign rolandic epilepsy (bre)? patients with this syndrome typically present between the ages of 3 and 13 years with nighttime seizures. the episodes usually begin with twitching and stiffness of the face, and often wake up the child.  the clonic activity causes a tingling feeling on one side of the mouth involving the tongue, lips, gum and inner side of the cheek.  the seizure may also involve the throat which may make speech unclear and difficult to understand.   occasionally, both sides of the body may be affected, which can lead to loss of consciousness causing stiffness and jerking movements of the arms and legs.  the child may also be incontinent.  after an episode, a child may be sleepy and doze for a few hours. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for benign rolandic epilepsy (bre). if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) bilateral convulsive seizures - eeg with centrotemporal focal spike waves - sporadic - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) childhood interstitial lung disease ?,"childhood interstitial (in-ter-stish-al) lung disease, or child, is a broad term for a group of rare lung diseases that can affect babies, children, and teens. these diseases have some similar symptoms, such as chronic cough, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath.
                
these diseases also harm the lungs in similar ways. for example, they damage the tissues that surround the lungs' alveoli (al-vee-uhl-eye; air sacs) and bronchial tubes (airways). sometimes these diseases directly damage the air sacs and airways.
                
the various types of child can decrease lung function, reduce blood oxygen levels, and disturb the breathing process.
                
overview
                
researchers have only begun to study, define, and understand child in the last decade. currently, they don't know how many children have child. they also don't know how many children have each type of child.
                
diagnosing child and its specific diseases is hard because child is rare and complex. also, child is a broad term for a group of diseases with similar symptomsit's not a precise diagnosis.
                
interstitial lung disease (ild) also occurs in adults. however, the cause of ild in adults may be different than the cause in children. some types of child are similar to the adult forms of the disease. they may even have the same names as the adult forms, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-ni-tis), immunodeficiency-associated lung disease, and bronchiolitis (brong-ke-o-li-tis) obliterans.
                
however, research shows that the course and outcomes of these diseases often are very different for children than for adults.
                
some ilds only occur in children. they include:
                
lung growth abnormalities
                
neuroendocrine (noor-o-en-do-krin) cell hyperplasia (hi-per-pla-ze-ah) of infancy (nehi)
                
pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (gli-ko-jen-eh-sis)
                
developmental disorders, such as alveolar (al-ve-o-lar) capillary dysplasia
                
outlook
                
each form of child may differ in its severity and how it's treated. thus, getting a correct diagnosis is vital for understanding and treating your child's illness.
                
you may want to consult a pediatric pulmonologist. this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions. this doctor's training and experience can help him or her diagnose child.
                
the outlook for children who have child also depends on the specific type of disease they have. some diseases are very severe and lead to early death. others are chronic (long-term) diseases that parents and the child's medical team must work together to manage.
                
at this time, child has no cure. however, some children who have certain diseases, such as nehi, may slowly improve over time.
                
researchers are now starting to learn more about the causes of child. they're also trying to find distinct patterns and traits for the various forms of child. this information may help doctors better understand these diseases."
is central core disease inherited ?,"central core disease is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  less commonly, central core disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. people who carry one mutated copy of the ryr1 gene, however, may be at increased risk for malignant hyperthermia."
is mannose-binding lectin deficiency inherited ?,"the inheritance pattern of mannose-binding lectin deficiency is unclear. some reports show that having a disease-associated mutation in one copy of the mbl2 gene in each cell can lead to the condition, while other reports state that a mutation in both copies of the gene is necessary. it is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of developing mannose-binding lectin deficiency, not the condition itself. not all people who inherit mutations in this gene will develop the condition."
what is (are) huntington disease-like syndrome ?,"as its name suggests, a huntington disease-like (hdl) syndrome is a condition that resembles huntington disease. researchers have described four hdl syndromes, designated huntington disease-like 1 (hdl1) through huntington disease-like 4 (hdl4). these progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. hdl syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of huntington disease who do not have a mutation in hd, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  hdl1, hdl2, and hdl4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. the first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. as the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. people with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. individuals with an hdl syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  hdl3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other hdl syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. because hdl3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other hdl syndromes."
what are the symptoms of guillain-barre syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of guillain-barre syndrome? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for guillain-barre syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) acute demyelinating polyneuropathy - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome ?,"people who have any signs or symptoms of severe dehydration should call or see a health care provider right away:
                
- excessive thirst  - dark-colored urine  - infrequent urination  - lethargy, dizziness, or faintness  - dry skin
                
infants, children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest chance of becoming dehydrated. people should watch for the following signs and symptoms of dehydration in infants, young children, and people who are unable to communicate their symptoms:
                
- dry mouth and tongue  - lack of tears when crying  - infants with no wet diapers for 3 hours or more  - infants with a sunken soft spot  - unusually cranky or drowsy behavior  - sunken eyes or cheeks  - fever
                
if left untreated, severe dehydration can cause serious health problems, such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious."
what are the genetic changes related to glycine encephalopathy ?,"mutations in the amt and gldc genes cause glycine encephalopathy.  about 80 percent of cases of glycine encephalopathy result from mutations in the gldc gene, while amt mutations cause 10 percent to 15 percent of all cases. in a small percentage of affected individuals, the cause of this condition is unknown.  the amt and gldc genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together as part of a larger enzyme complex. this complex, known as glycine cleavage enzyme, is responsible for breaking down glycine into smaller pieces. mutations in either the amt or gldc gene prevent the complex from breaking down glycine properly. when glycine cleavage enzyme is defective, excess glycine can build up to toxic levels in the body's organs and tissues. damage caused by harmful amounts of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord is responsible for the intellectual disability, seizures, and breathing difficulties characteristic of glycine encephalopathy."
what is the outlook for parkinson's disease ?,"pd is both chronic, meaning it persists over a long period of time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. although some people become severely disabled, others experience only minor motor disruptions. tremor is the major symptom for some individuals, while for others tremor is only a minor complaint and other symptoms are more troublesome. it is currently not possible to predict which symptoms will affect an individual, and the intensity of the symptoms also varies from person to person."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital plasminogen deficiency ?,"congenital plasminogen deficiency is caused by mutations in the plg gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called plasminogen. enzymes called plasminogen activators convert plasminogen into the protein plasmin, which breaks down another protein called fibrin. fibrin is the main protein involved in blood clots and is important for wound healing, creating the framework for normal tissue to grow back. excess fibrin is broken down when no longer needed, and the new, more flexible normal tissue takes its place.  plg gene mutations can decrease the amount of plasminogen that is produced, its function, or both. when the mutations affect plasminogen levels as well as the activity of the protein, affected individuals may be said to have type i congenital plasminogen deficiency, characterized by the ligneous growths previously described. people with mutations that result in normal levels of plasminogen with reduced activity are said to have type ii congenital plasminogen deficiency or dysplasminogenemia. this form of the condition often has no symptoms.  a reduction in functional plasminogen results in less plasmin to break down fibrin, leading to a buildup of fibrin. the excess fibrin and the resulting inflammation of the tissue result in the inflamed woody growths characteristic of congenital plasminogen deficiency.  it is unclear why the excess fibrin builds up in the mucous membranes but does not usually result in abnormal clots in the blood vessels (thromboses). researchers suggest that other enzymes in the blood may also break down fibrin, helping to compensate for the reduced plasminogen levels."
what is (are) pectus carinatum ?,"pectus carinatum refers to a chest wall abnormality in which the breastbone is pushed outward. it generally presents during childhood and worsens through adolescence. if the condition occurs in isolation, it is often not associated with any additional signs or symptoms. rarely, affected people report shortness of breath during exercise, frequent respiratory infections, and/or asthma. the underlying cause of isolated pectus carinatum is unknown. pectus carinatum can also be associated with a variety of genetic disorders and syndromes, including marfan syndrome, noonan syndrome, morquio syndrome, homocystinuria, osteogenesis imperfecta, coffin-lowery syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and certain chromosome abnormalities. in these cases, the condition has an underlying genetic cause and is associated with additional features that are characteristic of the genetic disease. pectus carinatum is primarily a cosmetic concern and treatment, therefore, depends on the severity of the condition and the interests of the affected person and their family. in those who choose to pursue treatment, bracing and/or surgery may be an option."
how to diagnose diverticular disease ?,"diverticulosis
                
health care providers often find diverticulosis during a routine x ray or a colonoscopy, a test used to look inside the rectum and entire colon to screen for colon cancer or polyps or to evaluate the source of rectal bleeding.
                
diverticular disease
                
based on symptoms and severity of illness, a person may be evaluated and diagnosed by a primary care physician, an emergency department physician, a surgeon, or a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.
                
the health care provider will ask about the persons health, symptoms, bowel habits, diet, and medications, and will perform a physical exam, which may include a rectal exam. a rectal exam is performed in the health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. to perform the exam, the health care provider asks the person to bend over a table or lie on one side while holding the knees close to the chest. the health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum. the exam is used to check for pain, bleeding, or a blockage in the intestine.
                
the health care provider may schedule one or more of the following tests:
                
- blood test. a blood test involves drawing a persons blood at a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show the presence of inflammation or anemiaa condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen.  - computerized tomography (ct) scan. a ct scan of the colon is the most common test used to diagnose diverticular disease. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3d) images. for a ct scan, the person may be given a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or a hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. anesthesia is not needed. ct scans can detect diverticulosis and confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis.  - lower gastrointestinal (gi) series. a lower gi series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. the test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. anesthesia is not needed. the health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. the person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. a laxative or enema may be used before the test. a laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. an enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. these medications cause diarrhea, so the person should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.   - for the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. the colon is filled with barium, making signs of diverticular disease show up more clearly on x rays.  - for several days, traces of barium in the large intestine can cause stools to be white or light colored. enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. a health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - colonoscopy. the test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. before the test, the persons health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. the person may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. the person may also need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test.  - in most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps people relax for the test. the person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. a small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. the test can show diverticulosis and diverticular disease.  - cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. driving is not permitted for 24 hours after the test to allow the anesthesia time to wear off. before the appointment, people should make plans for a ride home. full recovery is expected by the next day, and people should be able to go back to their normal diet."
what to do for viral gastroenteritis ?,"- viral gastroenteritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. several different viruses can cause viral gastroenteritis, which is highly contagious and extremely common.  - the main symptoms of viral gastroenteritis are watery diarrhea and vomiting.  - dehydration is the most common complication of viral gastroenteritis.  - when someone does not drink enough fluids to replace those that are lost through vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration can result. signs of dehydration in adults are excessive thirst, infrequent urination, dark-colored urine, dry skin, and lethargy, dizziness, or faintness.  - infants, young children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest risk of becoming dehydrated.  - viral gastroenteritis is transmitted from person to person.  - diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis is usually based on symptoms alone.  - most cases of viral gastroenteritis resolve over time without specific treatment. antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. the primary goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.  - adults with viral gastroenteritis should drink plenty of liquids such as fruit juices, sports drinks, caffeine-free soft drinks, and broths to replace fluids and electrolytes.  - children with viral gastroenteritis should be given oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration.  - people can reduce their chances of getting or spreading viral gastroenteritis if they wash their hands thoroughly with soap and warm water for 20 seconds after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before eating or handling food, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and avoid foods or liquids that might be contaminated."
what is (are) x-linked agammaglobulinemia ?,"x-linked agammaglobulinemia (xla) is a condition that affects the immune system and occurs almost exclusively in males. people with xla have very few b cells, which are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against infection. b cells can mature into the cells that produce special proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. antibodies attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. individuals with xla are more susceptible to infections because their body makes very few antibodies.  children with xla are usually healthy for the first 1 or 2 months of life because they are protected by antibodies acquired before birth from their mother. after this time, the maternal antibodies are cleared from the body, and the affected child begins to develop recurrent infections. in children with xla, infections generally take longer to get better and then they come back again, even with antibiotic medications. the most common bacterial infections that occur in people with xla are lung infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), ear infections (otitis), pink eye (conjunctivitis), and sinus infections (sinusitis). infections that cause chronic diarrhea are also common. recurrent infections can lead to organ damage. people with xla can develop severe, life-threatening bacterial infections; however, affected individuals are not particularly vulnerable to infections caused by viruses. with treatment to replace antibodies, infections can usually be prevented, improving the quality of life for people with xla."
what are the stages of penile cancer ?,"key points
                    - after penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.    - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - the following stages are used for penile cancer:          - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i     - stage ii     - stage iii     - stage iv
                
                
                    after penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. the tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:                -  sentinel lymph node biopsy : the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. it is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. if cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.      -  lymph node dissection : a procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery. a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. this procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. the disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for penile cancer:
                    stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    in stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like warts are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. these abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       stage i    in stage i, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. the tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.       stage ii    in stage ii, cancer has spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. also, cancer has spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              stage iii     stage iii is divided into stage iiia and stage iiib.     in stage iiia, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.           in stage iiib, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or      - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              stage iv    in stage iv, cancer has spread:            - to tissues near the penis such as the prostate, and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis; or      - to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread from the lymph nodes to the tissues around the lymph nodes; or     - to distant parts of the body."

what are the treatments for spinocerebellar ataxia 2 ?,"how might spinocerebellar ataxia 2 be treated? treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (sca2) is supportive and aims to help the affected person maintain their independence and avoid injury. it is recommended that people with sca2 remain physically active, maintain a healthy weight, use adaptive equipment as needed, and avoid alcohol and medications that affect cerebellar function. adaptive equipment may include canes or other devices to help with walking and mobility. people with sca2 may develop difficulty speaking and may need to use computerized devices or writing pads to help with communication. levodopa may be prescribed to help with some of the movement problems (e.g., rigidity and tremor), and magnesium may improve muscle cramping."
what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes ?,"although the exact causes of insulin resistance are not completely understood, scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity.
                
excess weight
                
some experts believe obesity, especially excess fat around the waist, is a primary cause of insulin resistance. scientists used to think that fat tissue functioned solely as energy storage. however, studies have shown that belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause serious health problems such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, imbalanced cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease (cvd).
                
belly fat plays a part in developing chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. chronic inflammation can damage the body over time, without any signs or symptoms. scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area and trigger low-level chronic inflammation. this inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cvd. studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.
                
physical inactivity
                
many studies have shown that physical inactivity is associated with insulin resistance, often leading to type 2 diabetes. in the body, more glucose is used by muscle than other tissues. normally, active muscles burn their stored glucose for energy and refill their reserves with glucose taken from the bloodstream, keeping blood glucose levels in balance.
                
studies show that after exercising, muscles become more sensitive to insulin, reversing insulin resistance and lowering blood glucose levels. exercise also helps muscles absorb more glucose without the need for insulin. the more muscle a body has, the more glucose it can burn to control blood glucose levels.
                
other causes
                
other causes of insulin resistance may include ethnicity; certain diseases; hormones; steroid use; some medications; older age; sleep problems, especially sleep apnea; and cigarette smoking.
                

                
does sleep matter?   yes. studies show that untreated sleep problems, especially sleep apnea, can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. night shift workers may also be at increased risk for these problems. sleep apnea is a common disorder in which a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. people may often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep when their breathing pauses or becomes shallow. this results in poor sleep quality that causes problem sleepiness, or excessive tiredness, during the day.   many people aren't aware of their symptoms and aren't diagnosed. people who think they might have sleep problems should talk with their health care provider.   more information about sleep problems is available from the national heart, lung, and blood institute at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/sleep."

what are the genetic changes related to megdel syndrome ?,"megdel syndrome is caused by mutations in the serac1 gene. the function of the protein produced from this gene is not completely understood, although research suggests that it is involved in altering (remodeling) certain fats called phospholipids, particularly a phospholipid known as phosphatidylglycerol. another phospholipid called cardiolipin is made from phosphatidylglycerol. cardiolipin is a component of the membrane that surrounds cellular structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, and is important for the proper functioning of these structures.  serac1 gene mutations involved in megdel syndrome lead to little or no serac1 protein function. as a result, phosphatidylglycerol remodeling is impaired, which likely alters the composition of cardiolipin. researchers speculate that the abnormal cardiolipin affects mitochondrial function, reducing cellular energy production and leading to the neurological and hearing problems characteristic of megdel syndrome. it is unclear how serac1 gene mutations lead to abnormal release of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine, although it is thought to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction."
what are the symptoms of intraocular (uveal) melanoma ?,signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris. intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. it is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - blurred vision or other change in vision.    - floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light.    - a dark spot on the iris.    - a change in the size or shape of the pupil.    - a change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket.
what causes tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome ?,"what causes tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (traps)? traps is a genetic condition caused by mutations in a gene called tnfrsf1a. this gene gives the body instructions to make a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (tnfr1). this protein exists in cell membranes where it binds to another protein called tumor necrosis factor (tnf). the binding sends signals that tell the cells to trigger inflammation (producing immune system proteins) or self-destruct. most tnfrsf1a gene mutations that cause traps result in incorrectly-shaped tnfr1 proteins, which become trapped in cells and cannot reach the surface to bind with tnf. the trapped proteins then clump together and are thought to trigger other pathways involved in causing inflammation. affected people typically have a mutation in only one of their 2 copies of the tnfrsf1a gene, so some normal tnfr1 proteins are still produced, leading to even more inflammation. this is what leads to excess inflammation in people with traps. it is unclear if abnormalities in the cells' ability to self-destruct also plays a role in causing the features of traps."
what are the symptoms of norum disease ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of norum disease? norum disease is marked by low plasma hdl levels and corneal clouding due to accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the cornea ('fish-eye'). corneal opacity is often present at birth, beginning at the periphery of the cornea and progressing gradually to the center. hemolytic anemia, and proteinuria are other common findings. this condition may also present with: papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve) with impaired ocular blood supply, leading to functional visual loss signs of renal insufficiency, including hypertension signs of atherosclerosis xanthelasma (in end-stage disease) hepatomegaly splenomegaly lymphadenopathy the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for norum disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) autosomal recessive inheritance - hemolytic anemia - hypertriglyceridemia - hypoalphalipoproteinemia - normochromic anemia - opacification of the corneal stroma - proteinuria - renal insufficiency - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what are the genetic changes related to arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency ?,"mutations in the gatm gene cause arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency. the gatm gene provides instructions for making the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase. this enzyme participates in the two-step production (synthesis) of the compound creatine from the protein building blocks (amino acids) glycine, arginine, and methionine. specifically, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase controls the first step of the process. in this step, a compound called guanidinoacetic acid is produced by transferring a cluster of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms called a guanidino group from arginine to glycine. guanidinoacetic acid is converted to creatine in the second step of the process. creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly.  gatm gene mutations impair the ability of the arginine:glycine amidinotransferase enzyme to participate in creatine synthesis, resulting in a shortage of creatine. the effects of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with hairy cell leukemia.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with hairy cell leukemia. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used:
                    watchful waiting     watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition, without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.       chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. cladribine and pentostatin are anticancer drugs commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia. these drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer, especially hodgkin lymphoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma. long-term follow up for second cancers is very important.       biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. interferon alfa is a biologic agent commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia.    see drugs approved for hairy cell leukemia for more information.       surgery      splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen.        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat hairy cell leukemia.    monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    a monoclonal antibody called rituximab may be used for certain patients with hairy cell leukemia.    other types of targeted therapies are being studied.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

how many people are affected by familial pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare condition. its incidence is unknown, although the familial form appears to be the least common type of pityriasis rubra pilaris."
is syndactyly type 3 inherited ?,"how is syndactyly type 3 inherited? syndactyly type 3 has been shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one mutated copy of the causative gene is sufficient to cause the condition. when an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal gene and being unaffected."
who is at risk for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma? ?,"certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk.   risk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following inherited diseases:         -  li-fraumeni syndrome.    -  pleuropulmonary blastoma.    -  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1).    -  costello syndrome.    -  beckwith-wiedemann syndrome.     -  noonan syndrome.        children who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.   in most cases, the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known."

how to diagnose multiple myeloma ?,"how is multiple myeloma diagnosed? a diagnosis of multiple myeloma may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. this may include: specialized blood tests including immunoglobulin studies, complete blood count with differential, and blood chemistry studies urine tests such as immunoglobulin studies and a twenty-four-hour urine test bone marrow aspiration and biopsy imaging studies such as an x-ray of the bones (skeletal bone survey), mri, ct scan, and/or pet scan the american cancer society offers more information regarding the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, including a summary of the many tests that may be recommended. please click on the link to access this resource. some affected people may have no suspicious signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma, especially in the early stages of the condition. in these cases, multiple myeloma is sometimes diagnosed by chance when a blood test or urine test is ordered to investigate another condition."
is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?,"most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. many people with type i or type iv osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type ii and type iii) have no history of the condition in their family. in these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the col1a1 or col1a2 gene.  less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type iii are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than col1a1 and col1a2. when osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the crtap or p3h1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

what is (are) am i at risk for type 2 diabetes? taking steps to lower your risk of getting diabetes ?,"type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common type of diabetes. about 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. however, this type of diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. people who are overweight and inactive are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
                
in type 2 and other types of diabetes, you have too much glucose, also called sugar, in your blood. people with diabetes have problems converting food to energy. after a meal, food is broken down into glucose, which is carried by your blood to cells throughout your body. with the help of the hormone insulin, cells absorb glucose from your blood and use it for energy. insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.
                
type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition linked to excess weight in which your bodys cells do not use insulin properly. as a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. at first, your pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. but in time, your pancreas loses its ability to produce enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.
                
over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. other problems of diabetes may include increased risk of getting other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems.
                
treatment includes taking diabetes medicines, making wise food choices, being physically active on a regular basis, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and for some, taking aspirin daily."

what is the outlook for gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - where the tumor is in the gastrointestinal tract.    - the size of the tumor.     - whether the cancer has spread from the stomach and intestines to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lymph nodes.    - whether the patient has carcinoid syndrome or has carcinoid heart syndrome.    - whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery.     - whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred."
how to diagnose gastroparesis ?,"gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gi tract, and gastric emptying tests. tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. to rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:
                
- upper gastrointestinal (gi) endoscopy. this procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenumthe first part of the small intestine. the test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. the endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. a person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. an intravenous (iv) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. the test may show blockage or large bezoarssolid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomachthat are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper gi endoscopy.  - upper gi series. an upper gi series may be done to look at the small intestine. the test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. anesthesia is not needed. no eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. if the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. during the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. a person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. for several days afterward, barium liquid in the gi tract causes stools to be white or light colored. a health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a persons digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis.  - gastric emptying scintigraphy. the test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. the test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. an external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. the radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. if more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed.  - smartpill. the smartpill is a small electronic device in capsule form. the smartpill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. the images are interpreted by a radiologist. the device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck. the recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.  - gastric emptying breath test. with this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. the results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying."
is duchenne muscular dystrophy inherited ?,"how do people inherit duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy? duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy are inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a striking characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in about two thirds of cases, an affected male inherits the mutation from a mother who carries an altered copy of the dmd gene. the other one third of cases probably result from new mutations in the gene. in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. she can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. occasionally, however, females who carry a dmd mutation may have muscle weakness and cramping. these symptoms are typically milder than the severe muscle weakness and atrophy seen in affected males. females who carry a dmd mutation also have an increased risk of developing heart abnormalities including dilated cardiomyopathy."
is bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria inherited ?,"is bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria inherited? in most cases, bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (bpp) occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. rarely, more than one family member may be affected by bpp. these cases may follow an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked pattern of inheritance."

what is (are) sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive ?,"sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive is an inherited blood disorder that is characterized by an impaired ability of the bone marrow to produce normal red blood cells. the iron inside red blood cells is inadequately used to make hemoglobin, despite adequate or increased amounts of iron. abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts are found in the blood of people with this anemia. it is caused by mutations in the slc25a38 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. unlike other forms of sideroblastic anemia, this form is not responsive to vitamin b6 (pyridoxine)."
what is (are) aarskog-scott syndrome ?,"aarskog-scott syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of many parts of the body. this condition mainly affects males, although females may have mild features of the syndrome.  people with aarskog-scott syndrome often have distinctive facial features, such as widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small nose, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), and a widow's peak hairline. they frequently have mild to moderate short stature during childhood, but their growth usually catches up during puberty. hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include short fingers (brachydactyly), curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly), webbing of the skin between some fingers (syndactyly), and a single crease across the palm. some people with aarskog-scott syndrome are born with more serious abnormalities, such as heart defects or a cleft lip with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).  most males with aarskog-scott syndrome have a shawl scrotum, in which the scrotum surrounds the penis. less often, they have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia).  the intellectual development of people with aarskog-scott syndrome varies widely among affected individuals. some may have mild learning and behavior problems, while others have normal intelligence. in rare cases, severe intellectual disability has been reported."
what is (are) aicardi-goutieres syndrome type 4 ?,"aicardi-goutieres syndrome is an inherited condition that mainly affects the brain, immune system, and skin. it is characterized by early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. there are six different types of aicardi-goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: trex1, rnaseh2a, rnaseh2b, rnaseh2c, samhd1, and adar genes. most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
what are the treatments for tuberculosis (tb) ?,"tuberculosis (tb) is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis. the bacteria usually attack the lungs, but tb bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. if not treated properly, tb disease can be fatal.
  
not everyone infected with tb bacteria becomes sick. as a result, two tb-related conditions exist: latent tb infection and tb disease. both latent tb infection and tb disease can be treated. learn more about the difference between latent tb infection and tb disease.
  
     treatment for latent tb infection
  
people with latent tb infection have tb bacteria in their bodies, but they are not sick because the bacteria are not active. people with latent tb infection do not have symptoms, and they cannot spread tb bacteria to others. however, if tb bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent tb infection to being sick with tb disease. for this reason, people with latent tb infection are often prescribed treatment to prevent them from developing tb disease. treatment of latent tb infection is essential for controlling and eliminating tb in the united states.
  
because there are less bacteria in a person with latent tb infection, treatment is much easier. four regimens are approved for the treatment of latent tb infection. the medications used to treat latent tb infection include:
  
   - isoniazid (inh)
   - rifampin (rif)
   - rifapentine (rpt)
  
  
certain groups of people (such as people with weakened immune systems) are at very high risk of developing tb disease once infected with tb bacteria. every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent tb infection.

     treatment for tb disease
  
tb bacteria become active (multiplying in the body) if the immune system can't stop them from growing. when tb bacteria are active, this is called tb disease. tb disease will make a person sick. people with tb disease may spread the bacteria to people with whom they spend many hours.
  
tb disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. there are 10 drugs currently approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for treating tb. of the approved drugs, the first-line anti-tb agents that form the core of treatment regimens include:
  
   - isoniazid (inh)
   - rifampin (rif)
   - ethambutol (emb)
   - pyrazinamide (pza)
  
  
regimens for treating tb disease have an initial phase of 2 months, followed by a choice of several options for the continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months (total of 6 to 9 months for treatment). learn more about the continuation phase of treatment.
  
it is very important that people who have tb disease finish the medicine, taking the drugs exactly as prescribed. if they stop taking the drugs too soon, they can become sick again; if they do not take the drugs correctly, the tb bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. tb that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat.

     treatment completion
  
treatment completion is determined by the number of doses ingested over a given period of time. although basic tb regimens are broadly applicable, there are modifications that should be made under special circumstances (such as people with hiv infection, drug resistance, pregnancy, or treatment of children)."
do you have information about safety,"summary : you can't remove all the safety hazards from your life, but you can reduce them. to avoid many major hazards and prepare for emergencies       -  keep emergency phone numbers by your telephones    -  make a first aid kit for your home    -  make a family emergency plan    -  install and maintain smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors    -  keep guns unloaded and locked up. lock up the ammunition separately.     -  follow the directions carefully when using tools or equipment       young children are especially at risk. supervision is the best way to keep them safe. childproofing the house can also help."
what causes overweight and obesity ?,"lack of energy balance
                
a lack of energy balance most often causes overweight and obesity. energy balance means that your energy in equals your energy out.
                
energy in is the amount of energy or calories you get from food and drinks. energy out is the amount of energy your body uses for things like breathing, digesting, and being physically active.
                
to maintain a healthy weight, your energy in and out don't have to balance exactly every day. it's the balance over time that helps you maintain a healthy weight.
                
the same amount of energy in and energy out over time = weight stays the same
                
more energy in than energy out over time = weight gain
                
more energy out than energy in over time = weight loss
                
overweight and obesity happen over time when you take in more calories than you use.
                
other causes
                
an inactive lifestyle
                
many americans aren't very physically active. one reason for this is that many people spend hours in front of tvs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. in fact, more than 2 hours a day of regular tv viewing time has been linked to overweight and obesity.
                
other reasons for not being active include: relying on cars instead of walking, fewer physical demands at work or at home because of modern technology and conveniences, and lack of physical education classes in schools.
                
people who are inactive are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn the calories that they take in from food and drinks. an inactive lifestyle also raises your risk for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer, and other health problems.
                
environment
                
our environment doesn't support healthy lifestyle habits; in fact, it encourages obesity. some reasons include:
                
lack of neighborhood sidewalks and safe places for recreation. not having area parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active.
                
work schedules. people often say that they don't have time to be physically active because of long work hours and time spent commuting.
                
oversized food portions. americans are exposed to huge food portions in restaurants, fast food places, gas stations, movie theaters, supermarkets, and even at home. some of these meals and snacks can feed two or more people. eating large portions means too much energy in. over time, this will cause weight gain if it isn't balanced with physical activity.
                
lack of access to healthy foods. some people don't live in neighborhoods that have supermarkets that sell healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. or, for some people, these healthy foods are too costly.
                
food advertising. americans are surrounded by ads from food companies. often children are the targets of advertising for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks. the goal of these ads is to sway people to buy these high-calorie foods, and often they do.
                
genes and family history
                
studies of identical twins who have been raised apart show that genes have a strong influence on a person's weight. overweight and obesity tend to run in families. your chances of being overweight are greater if one or both of your parents are overweight or obese.
                
your genes also may affect the amount of fat you store in your body and where on your body you carry the extra fat. because families also share food and physical activity habits, a link exists between genes and the environment.
                
children adopt the habits of their parents. a child who has overweight parents who eat high-calorie foods and are inactive will likely become overweight too. however, if the family adopts healthy food and physical activity habits, the child's chance of being overweight or obese is reduced.
                
health conditions
                
some hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos).
                
underactive thyroid is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. lack of thyroid hormone will slow down your metabolism and cause weight gain. you'll also feel tired and weak.
                
cushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body's adrenal glands make too much of the hormone cortisol. cushing's syndrome also can develop if a person takes high doses of certain medicines, such as prednisone, for long periods.
                
people who have cushing's syndrome gain weight, have upper-body obesity, a rounded face, fat around the neck, and thin arms and legs.
                
pcos is a condition that affects about 510 percent of women of childbearing age. women who have pcos often are obese, have excess hair growth, and have reproductive problems and other health issues. these problems are caused by high levels of hormones called androgens.
                
medicines
                
certain medicines may cause you to gain weight. these medicines include some corticosteroids, antidepressants, and seizure medicines.
                
these medicines can slow the rate at which your body burns calories, increase your appetite, or cause your body to hold on to extra water. all of these factors can lead to weight gain.
                
emotional factors
                
some people eat more than usual when they're bored, angry, or stressed. over time, overeating will lead to weight gain and may cause overweight or obesity.
                
smoking
                
some people gain weight when they stop smoking. one reason is that food often tastes and smells better after quitting smoking.
                
another reason is because nicotine raises the rate at which your body burns calories, so you burn fewer calories when you stop smoking. however, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.
                
age
                
as you get older, you tend to lose muscle, especially if you're less active. muscle loss can slow down the rate at which your body burns calories. if you don't reduce your calorie intake as you get older, you may gain weight.
                
midlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but menopause also plays a role. many women gain about 5 pounds during menopause and have more fat around the waist than they did before.
                
pregnancy
                
during pregnancy, women gain weight to support their babies growth and development. after giving birth, some women find it hard to lose the weight. this may lead to overweight or obesity, especially after a few pregnancies.
                
lack of sleep
                
research shows that lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity. for example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well.
                
people who sleep fewer hours also seem to prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates, which can lead to overeating, weight gain, and obesity.
                
sleep helps maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin). when you don't get enough sleep, your level of ghrelin goes up and your level of leptin goes down. this makes you feel hungrier than when you're well-rested.
                
sleep also affects how your body reacts to insulin, the hormone that controls your blood glucose (sugar) level. lack of sleep results in a higher than normal blood sugar level, which may increase your risk for diabetes.

how to diagnose imerslund-grasbeck syndrome ?,"how is imerslund-grasbeck syndrome diagnosed? the diagnosis of imerslund-grasbeck syndrome (igs) is made after a series of tests are performed. cobalamin deficiency is typically detected first, followed by showing that cobalamin is poorly absorbed (the main cause of cobalamin deficiency). other known causes of vitamin b12 malabsorption must then be ruled out. lastly, it must be shown that after correcting the deficiency, the only nutrient to be poorly absorbed is vitamin b12. the diagnosis can also be confirmed by having genetic testing of the genes that are known to cause the condition. while the presence of proteinuria is strongly suggestive of igs, not all affected individuals have proteinuria."
how to prevent parasites - trichuriasis (also known as whipworm infection) ?,"the best way to prevent whipworm infection is to always:
    
     - avoid ingesting soil that may be contaminated with human feces, including where human fecal matter (""night soil"") or wastewater is used to fertilize crops.
     - wash your hands with soap and warm water before handling food.
     - teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
     - wash, peel, or cook all raw vegetables and fruits before eating, particularly those that have been grown in soil that has been fertilized with manure.
    
    
more on: handwashing
    
transmission of infection to others can be prevented by
    
     - not defecating outdoors.
     - effective sewage disposal systems."
what are the symptoms of marfan syndrome ?,"marfan syndrome can affect many parts of the body. as a result, the signs and symptoms of the disorder vary from person to person, even in the same family.
                
marfan complications also vary, depending on how the condition affects your body. marfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord. this can cause many complications, some of which are life threatening.
                
marfan traits
                
marfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body. this can lead to signs, or traits, such as:
                
a tall, thin build.
                
long arms, legs, fingers, and toes and flexible joints.
                
a spine that curves to one side. this condition is called scoliosis.
                
a chest that sinks in or sticks out. these conditions are called pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum, respectively.
                
teeth that are too crowded.
                
flat feet.
                
stretch marks on the skin also are a common trait in people who have marfan syndrome. stretch marks usually appear on the lower back, buttocks, shoulders, breasts, thighs, and abdomen.
                
not everyone who has these traits has marfan syndrome. some of these traits also are signs of other connective tissue disorders.
                
complications of marfan syndrome
                
heart and blood vessel complications
                
the most serious complications of marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels.
                
marfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. in marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. this condition is called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm.
                
if the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear and leak blood. this condition, called aortic dissection, can lead to severe heart problems or even death.
                
aortic dissection can cause severe pain in either the front or back of the chest or abdomen. the pain can travel upward or downward. if you have symptoms of aortic dissection, call 911.
                
marfan syndrome also can cause problems with the heart's mitral (mi-trul) valve. this valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart. marfan syndrome can lead to mitral valve prolapse (mvp).
                
mvp is a condition in which the flaps of the mitral valve are floppy and don't close tightly. mvp can cause shortness of breath, palpitations (pal-pi-ta-shuns), chest pain, and other symptoms.
                
if you have mvp, your doctor may hear a heart murmur if he or she listens to your heart with a stethoscope. a heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat.
                
eye complications
                
marfan syndrome can cause many eye problems. a common problem in marfan syndrome is a dislocated lens in one or both of the eyes. in this condition, the lens (the part of the eye that helps focus light) shifts up, down, or to the side. this can affect your eyesight. a dislocated lens often is the first sign that someone has marfan syndrome.
                
other eye complications of marfan syndrome include nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and early cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens). a detached retina also can occur.
                
nervous system complications
                
fluid surrounds your brain and spinal cord. a substance called dura covers the fluid. in marfan syndrome, the dura can stretch and grow weak.
                
this condition, called dural ectasia (ek-ta-ze-ah), can occur in people who have marfan syndrome as they grow older. eventually, the bones of the spine may wear away.
                
symptoms of this condition are lower back pain, abdominal pain, headache, and numbness in the legs.
                
lung complications
                
marfan syndrome can cause sudden pneumothorax (noo-mo-thor-aks), or collapsed lung. in this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and chest wall. if enough air or gas builds up, a lung can collapse.
                
the most common symptoms of a collapsed lung are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath.
                
conditions such as scoliosis (a curved spine) and pectus excavatum (a chest that sinks in) can prevent the lungs from expanding fully. this can cause breathing problems. marfan syndrome also can cause changes in the lung tissue, and it can lead to early emphysema (em-fi-se-ma).
                
marfan syndrome also has been linked to sleep apnea. in people who have marfan syndrome, the shape of the face, oral cavity, or teeth may increase the risk of sleep apnea. sleep apnea causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
                
breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. they often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour. typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound."
what are the symptoms of autosomal recessive charcot-marie-tooth disease with hoarseness ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive charcot-marie-tooth disease with hoarseness? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for autosomal recessive charcot-marie-tooth disease with hoarseness. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) onion bulb formation 7.5% areflexia - autosomal recessive inheritance - axonal degeneration/regeneration - decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - distal amyotrophy - distal muscle weakness - distal sensory impairment - flexion contracture - neonatal onset - pes cavus - spinal deformities - split hand - vocal cord paresis - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?,"how might type 1 plasminogen deficiency be treated? the treatment options available for type 1 plasminogen deficiency are few. however, some researchers have shown that the ligneous lesions can be reversed by plasminogen infusion, with changes occurring within 3 days and restored to normal after 2 weeks of treatment. recurrence has been prevented by daily injections with plasminogen sufficient to achieve plasma concentrations to approximately 40% of the normal amount of plasminogen. treatment with topical plasminogen has also been successful and resulted in dramatic improvement and complete resolution of the membranes. in some women, treatment with oral contraceptives have resulted in an increase in the levels of plasminogen and some resolution of the pseudomembrane."
what are the genetic changes related to familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency ?,"mutations in the lpl gene cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. the lpl gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which is found primarily on the surface of cells that line tiny blood vessels (capillaries) within muscles and fatty (adipose) tissue. this enzyme helps break down fats called triglycerides, which are carried by molecules called lipoproteins.  mutations that cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency lead to a reduction or elimination of lipoprotein lipase activity, which prevents the enzyme from effectively breaking down triglycerides. as a result, triglycerides attached to lipoproteins build up in the blood and tissues, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency."
do you have information about cervical cancer screening,"summary : the cervix is the lower part of the uterus, the place where a baby grows during pregnancy. cancer screening is looking for cancer before you have any symptoms. cancer found early may be easier to treat.    cervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup. there are two types of tests: the pap test and the hpv test. for both, the doctor or nurse collects cells from the surface of the cervix. with the pap test, the lab checks the sample for cancer cells or abnormal cells that could become cancer later. with the hpv test, the lab checks for hpv infection. hpv is a virus that spreads through sexual contact. it can sometimes lead to cancer. if your screening tests are abnormal, your doctor may do more tests, such as a biopsy.    cervical cancer screening has risks. the results can sometimes be wrong, and you may have unnecessary follow-up tests. there are also benefits. screening has been shown to decrease the number of deaths from cervical cancer. you and your doctor should discuss your risk for cervical cancer, the pros and cons of the screening tests, at what age to start being screened, and how often to be screened."
what is (are) meningococcal infections ?,"meningococci are a type of bacteria that cause serious infections. the most common infection is meningitis, which is an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. meningococci can also cause other problems, including a serious bloodstream infection called sepsis.    meningococcal infections can spread from person to person. risk factors include       - age - it is more common in infants, teens, and young adults    - living in close quarters, such as in college dorms or military settings    - certain medical conditions, such as not having a spleen    - travel to areas where meningococcal disease is common       in its early stages, you may have flu-like symptoms and a stiff neck. but the disease can progress quickly and can be fatal. early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. lab tests on your blood and cerebrospinal fluid can tell if you have it. treatment is with antibiotics. since the infection spreads from person to person, family members may also need to be treated.    a vaccine can prevent meningococcal infections."
what are the symptoms of wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors ?,"signs of wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine. sometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a mass in the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a well-child health check up. these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions. check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         - a lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.    - blood in the urine.     -  high blood pressure (headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or trouble seeing or breathing).    -  hypercalcemia (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weakness, or feeling very tired).    -  fever for no known reason.    - loss of appetite.    - weight loss for no known reason.        wilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:         - cough.    - blood in the sputum.    - trouble breathing.    - pain in the abdomen."
what is (are) primary hyperoxaluria ?,"primary hyperoxaluria is a rare condition characterized by recurrent kidney and bladder stones. the condition often results in end stage renal disease (esrd), which is a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.  primary hyperoxaluria results from the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and excreted as a waste product in urine, leading to abnormally high levels of this substance in urine (hyperoxaluria). during its excretion, oxalate can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. deposits of calcium oxalate can damage the kidneys and other organs and lead to blood in the urine (hematuria), urinary tract infections, kidney damage, esrd, and injury to other organs. over time, kidney function decreases such that the kidneys can no longer excrete as much oxalate as they receive. as a result oxalate levels in the blood rise, and the substance gets deposited in tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis), particularly in bones and the walls of blood vessels. oxalosis in bones can cause fractures.  there are three types of primary hyperoxaluria that differ in their severity and genetic cause. in primary hyperoxaluria type 1, kidney stones typically begin to appear anytime from childhood to early adulthood, and esrd can develop at any age. primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is similar to type 1, but esrd develops later in life. in primary hyperoxaluria type 3, affected individuals often develop kidney stones in early childhood, but few cases of this type have been described so additional signs and symptoms of this type are unclear."
how many people are affected by alkaptonuria ?,"this condition is rare, affecting 1 in 250,000 to 1 million people worldwide. alkaptonuria is more common in certain areas of slovakia (where it has an incidence of about 1 in 19,000 people) and in the dominican republic."

what are the symptoms of indigestion ?,"most people with indigestion experience more than one of the following symptoms:
                
- fullness during a meal. the person feels overly full soon after the meal starts and cannot finish the meal.  - bothersome fullness after a meal. the person feels overly full after a mealit may feel like the food is staying in the stomach too long.  - epigastric pain. the epigastric area is between the lower end of the chest bone and the navel. the person may experience epigastric pain ranging from mild to severe.  - epigastric burning. the person feels an unpleasant sensation of heat in the epigastric area.
                
other, less frequent symptoms that may occur with indigestion are nausea and bloatingan unpleasant tightness in the stomach. nausea and bloating could be due to causes other than indigestion.
                
sometimes the term indigestion is used to describe the symptom of heartburn, but these are two different conditions. heartburn is a painful, burning feeling in the chest that radiates toward the neck or back. heartburn is caused by stomach acid rising into the esophagus and may be a symptom of gerd. a person can have symptoms of both indigestion and heartburn."
what is (are) spondylothoracic dysostosis ?,"spondylothoracic dysostosis is a rare condition that affects the bones of the spine and the ribs. signs and symptoms are generally present at birth and may include short-trunk dwarfism (a short body with normal length arms and legs); a small chest cavity; misshapen and abnormally fused vertebrae (bones of the spine); and fused ribs at the part nearest the spine. affected people may also have life-threatening breathing problems and recurrent lung infections, which can significantly reduce lifespan. spondylothoracic dysostosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the mesp2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include surgery for bone malformations and respiratory support."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for adult non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
				                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     vaccine therapy     vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy. biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy.
				                
				                
				                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
				                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
				                
				                
				                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
				                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what is (are) adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency ?,"adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a neurological disorder that causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) leading to delayed development of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor delay), autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction, and seizures. a characteristic feature that can help with diagnosis of this condition is the presence of chemicals called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (saicar) and succinyladenosine (s-ado) in body fluids.  adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is classified into three forms based on the severity of the signs and symptoms. the most severe is the neonatal form. signs and symptoms of this form can be detected at or before birth and can include impaired growth during fetal development and a small head size (microcephaly). affected newborns have severe encephalopathy, which leads to a lack of movement, difficulty feeding, and life-threatening respiratory problems. some affected babies develop seizures that do not improve with treatment. because of the severity of the encephalopathy, infants with this form of the condition generally do not survive more than a few weeks after birth.  adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency type i (also known as the severe form) is the most common. the signs and symptoms of this form begin in the first months of life. affected babies have severe psychomotor delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and microcephaly. many affected infants develop recurrent seizures that are difficult to treat, and some exhibit autistic behaviors, such as repetitive behaviors and a lack of eye contact.  in individuals with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency type ii (also known as the moderate or mild form), development is typically normal for the first few years of life but then slows. psychomotor delay is considered mild or moderate. some children with this form of the condition develop seizures and autistic behaviors."
what is (are) henoch-schonlein purpura ?,"henoch-schonlein purpura (hsp) is a disease that involves purple spots on the skin (purpura), joint pain, digestive problems, and glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disorder). while the cause of this condition is not fully understood, it may develop as an immune response to an infection. hsp is usually seen in children, but it may affect people of any age. most cases go away on their own without treatment. for those cases which require treatment, the main goal is to relieve symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, or swelling. in many cases, over-the-counter medicines can be used. in some patients with severe arthritis, prednisone, a steroid medicine, may be prescribed."
what are the treatments for ankylosing spondylitis ?,"how might ankylosing spondylitis be treated? the main goal of treatment for people with ankylosing spondylitis (as) is to maximize long-term quality of life. this may involve easing symptoms of pain and stiffness; retaining function; preventing complications (such as contractures); and minimizing the effects of associated conditions. education, exercise, and medications are all very important in managing as. an exercise program is recommended for all affected people, and some may need individual physical therapy. affected people are encouraged to speak with their health care provider before instituting any changes to an exercise regime. video demonstrations of exercises tailored for ankylosing spondylitis are available for viewing through the national ankylosing spondylitis society in the uk. medications may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids); pain relievers; sulfasalazine; and anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs. steroid injections may be helpful for some people. most people don't need surgery, but it may be indicated when there is severe, persistent pain or severe limitation in mobility and quality of life. smoking creates additional problems for people with as, so affected people who smoke should quit. more detailed information about the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis is available on medscape's web site. you may need to register to view the article, but registration is free."
what are the treatments for arrhythmia ?,"common arrhythmia treatments include medicines, medical procedures, and surgery. your doctor may recommend treatment if your arrhythmia causes serious symptoms, such as dizziness, chest pain, or fainting.
                
your doctor also may recommend treatment if the arrhythmia increases your risk for problems such as heart failure, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest.
                
medicines
                
medicines can slow down a heart that's beating too fast. they also can change an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal, steady rhythm. medicines that do this are called antiarrhythmics.
                
some of the medicines used to slow a fast heart rate are beta blockers (such as metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil), and digoxin (digitalis). these medicines often are used to treat atrial fibrillation (af).
                
some of the medicines used to restore a normal heart rhythm are amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, ibutilide, quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. these medicines often have side effects. some side effects can make an arrhythmia worse or even cause a different kind of arrhythmia.
                
currently, no medicine can reliably speed up a slow heart rate. abnormally slow heart rates are treated with pacemakers.
                
people who have af and some other arrhythmias may be treated with blood-thinning medicines. these medicines reduce the risk of blood clots forming. warfarin (coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin are examples of blood-thinning medicines.
                
medicines also can control an underlying medical condition that might be causing an arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a thyroid condition.
                
medical procedures
                
some arrhythmias are treated with pacemakers. a pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms.
                
pacemakers have sensors that detect the heart's electrical activity. when the device senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it sends electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.
                
some arrhythmias are treated with a jolt of electricity to the heart. this type of treatment is called cardioversion or defibrillation, depending on which type of arrhythmia is being treated.
                
some people who are at risk for ventricular fibrillation are treated with a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd). like a pacemaker, an icd is a small device that's placed under the skin in the chest. this device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control life-threatening arrhythmias.
                
an icd continuously monitors the heartbeat. if it senses a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, it sends an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.
                
a procedure called catheter ablation is used to treat some arrhythmias if medicines don't work. during this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. then, the tube is guided to your heart.
                
a special machine sends energy through the tube to your heart. the energy finds and destroys small areas of heart tissue where abnormal heart rhythms may start. catheter ablation usually is done in a hospital as part of an electrophysiology study.
                
your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography before catheter ablation to make sure no blood clots are present in the atria (the heart's upper chambers).
                
surgery
                
doctors treat some arrhythmias with surgery. this may occur if surgery is already being done for another reason, such as repair of a heart valve.
                
one type of surgery for af is called maze surgery. during this surgery, a surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. these cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals.
                
if coronary heart disease is the cause of your arrhythmia, your doctor may recommend coronary artery bypass grafting. this surgery improves blood flow to the heart muscle.
                
other treatments
                
vagal maneuvers are another type of treatment for arrhythmia. these simple exercises sometimes can stop or slow down certain types of supraventricular arrhythmias. they do this by affecting the vagus nerve, which helps control the heart rate.
                
some vagal maneuvers include:
                
gagging
                
holding your breath and bearing down (valsalva maneuver)
                
immersing your face in ice-cold water
                
coughing
                
putting your fingers on your eyelids and pressing down gently
                
vagal maneuvers aren't an appropriate treatment for everyone. discuss with your doctor whether vagal maneuvers are an option for you."
is essential thrombocythemia inherited ?,"most cases of essential thrombocythemia are not inherited. instead, the condition arises from gene mutations that occur in early blood-forming cells after conception. these alterations are called somatic mutations.  less commonly, essential thrombocythemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. when it is inherited, the condition is called familial essential thrombocythemia."
is pseudoachondroplasia inherited ?,"pseudoachondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

what are the genetic changes related to prostate cancer ?,"cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged dna. these changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. in most cases of prostate cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a man's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the prostate. these changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in prostate cancer cells. less commonly, genetic changes present in essentially all of the body's cells increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. these genetic changes, which are classified as germline mutations, are usually inherited from a parent. in people with germline mutations, changes in other genes, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a person will develop prostate cancer.  inherited mutations in particular genes, such as brca1, brca2, and hoxb13, account for some cases of hereditary prostate cancer. men with mutations in these genes have a high risk of developing prostate cancer and, in some cases, other cancers during their lifetimes. in addition, men with brca2 or hoxb13 gene mutations may have a higher risk of developing life-threatening forms of prostate cancer.  the proteins produced from the brca1 and brca2 genes are involved in fixing damaged dna, which helps to maintain the stability of a cell's genetic information. for this reason, the brca1 and brca2 proteins are considered to be tumor suppressors, which means that they help keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. mutations in these genes impair the cell's ability to fix damaged dna, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist. as these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor.  the hoxb13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes. on the basis of this role, the protein produced from the hoxb13 gene is called a transcription factor. like brca1 and brca2, the hoxb13 protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor. hoxb13 gene mutations may result in impairment of the protein's tumor suppressor function, resulting in the uncontrolled cell growth and division that can lead to prostate cancer.  inherited variations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for prostate cancer. some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the brca1, brca2, or hoxb13 genes. others act as tumor suppressors through different pathways. changes in these genes probably make only a small contribution to overall prostate cancer risk. however, researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in many of these genes may significantly impact a person's risk of developing this form of cancer.  in many families, the genetic changes associated with hereditary prostate cancer are unknown. identifying additional genetic risk factors for prostate cancer is an active area of medical research.  in addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that may contribute to a person's risk of developing prostate cancer. these factors include a high-fat diet that includes an excess of meat and dairy and not enough vegetables, a largely inactive (sedentary) lifestyle, obesity, excessive alcohol use, or exposure to certain toxic chemicals. a history of prostate cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred at an early age."

what causes thrombocytopenia ?,"many factors can cause thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count). the condition can be inherited or acquired. ""inherited"" means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. ""acquired"" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia isn't known.
                
in general, a low platelet count occurs because:
                
the body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets.
                
the bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.
                
the spleen holds on to too many platelets.
                
a combination of the above factors also may cause a low platelet count.
                
the bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets
                
bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. it contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. when stem cells are damaged, they don't grow into healthy blood cells.
                
many conditions and factors can damage stem cells.
                
cancer
                
cancer, such as leukemia (lu-ke-me-ah) or lymphoma (lim-fo-ma), can damage the bone marrow and destroy blood stem cells. cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also destroy the stem cells.
                
aplastic anemia
                
aplastic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder in which the bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells. this lowers the number of platelets in your blood.
                
toxic chemicals
                
exposure to toxic chemicalssuch as pesticides, arsenic, and benzenecan slow the production of platelets.
                
medicines
                
some medicines, such as diuretics and chloramphenicol, can slow the production of platelets. chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) rarely is used in the united states.
                
common over-the-counter medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, also can affect platelets.
                
alcohol
                
alcohol also slows the production of platelets. a temporary drop in the platelet count is common among heavy drinkers, especially if they're eating foods that are low in iron, vitamin b12, or folate.
                
viruses
                
chickenpox, mumps, rubella, epstein-barr virus, or parvovirus can decrease your platelet count for a while. people who have aids often develop thrombocytopenia.
                
genetic conditions
                
some genetic conditions can cause low numbers of platelets in the blood. examples include wiskott-aldrich and may-hegglin syndromes.
                
the body destroys its own platelets
                
a low platelet count can occur even if the bone marrow makes enough platelets. the body may destroy its own platelets due to autoimmune diseases, certain medicines, infections, surgery, pregnancy, and some conditions that cause too much blood clotting.
                
autoimmune diseases
                
autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the body. if an autoimmune disease destroys the body's platelets, thrombocytopenia can occur.
                
one example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (itp). itp is a bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. an autoimmune response is thought to cause most cases of itp.
                
normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. but if you have itp, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. why this happens isn't known. (itp also may occur if the immune system attacks your bone marrow, which makes platelets.)
                
other autoimmune diseases that destroy platelets include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
                
medicines
                
a reaction to medicine can confuse your body and cause it to destroy its platelets. examples of medicines that may cause this to happen include quinine; antibiotics that contain sulfa; and some medicines for seizures, such as dilantin, vancomycin, and rifampin. (quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.)
                
heparin is a medicine commonly used to prevent blood clots. but an immune reaction may trigger the medicine to cause blood clots and thrombocytopenia. this condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit). hit rarely occurs outside of a hospital.
                
in hit, the body's immune system attacks a substance formed by heparin and a protein on the surface of the platelets. this attack activates the platelets and they start to form blood clots.
                
blood clots can form deep in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), or they can break loose and travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).
                
infection
                
a low platelet count can occur after blood poisoning from a widespread bacterial infection. a virus, such as mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus, also can cause a low platelet count.
                
surgery
                
platelets can be destroyed when they pass through man-made heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubing used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery.
                
pregnancy
                
about 5 percent of pregnant women develop mild thrombocytopenia when they're close to delivery. the exact cause isn't known for sure.
                
rare and serious conditions that cause blood clots
                
some rare and serious conditions can cause a low platelet count. two examples are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic).
                
ttp is a rare blood condition. it causes blood clots to form in the body's small blood vessels, including vessels in the brains, kidneys, and heart.
                
dic is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. tiny blood clots form suddenly throughout the body.
                
in both conditions, the blood clots use up many of the blood's platelets.
                
the spleen holds on to too many platelets
                
usually, one-third of the body's platelets are held in the spleen. if the spleen is enlarged, it will hold on to too many platelets. this means that not enough platelets will circulate in the blood.
                
an enlarged spleen often is due to cancer or severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis (sir-ro-sis). cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver is scarred. this prevents it from working well.
                
an enlarged spleen also might be due to a bone marrow condition, such as myelofibrosis (mi-eh-lo-fi-bro-sis). with this condition, the bone marrow is scarred and isn't able to make blood cells."

"what is (are) ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer ?","key points
                    - ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.    - ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system.
                
                
                    ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
                    the ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. they are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. the ovaries make eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs work in the body).   the fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.   the peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.
                
                
                    ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system.
                    in recent years, there has been a small decrease in the number of new cases of ovarian cancer and the number of deaths from ovarian cancer. new cases of ovarian cancer and deaths from ovarian cancer are higher among white women than black women, but have decreased in both groups.   women who have a family history of ovarian cancer and/or certain inherited gene changes, such as brca1 or brca2 gene changes, have a higher risk than women who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. for women with inherited risk, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be used to find out more about how likely they are to develop ovarian cancer.   it is hard to find ovarian cancer early. early ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms. when symptoms do appear, ovarian cancer is often advanced.   see the following pdq summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:         -  genetics of breast and gynecologic cancers (written for health professionals)    -  ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening     -  ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer treatment"
what is (are) familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency ?,"familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is an inherited condition that disrupts the normal breakdown of fats in the body, resulting in an increase of certain kinds of fats.  people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency typically develop signs and symptoms before age 10, with one-quarter showing symptoms by age 1. the first symptom of this condition is usually abdominal pain, which can vary from mild to severe. the abdominal pain is often due to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). these episodes of pancreatitis begin as sudden (acute) attacks. if left untreated, pancreatitis can develop into a chronic condition that can damage the pancreas and, in rare cases, be life-threatening.  affected individuals may also have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). the higher the levels of fat in the body, the larger the liver and spleen become. as fat levels rise, certain white blood cells called macrophages take in excess fat in an attempt to rid fat from the bloodstream. after taking in fat, the macrophages travel to the liver and spleen, where the fatty cells accumulate.  approximately half of individuals with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency develop small yellow deposits of fat under the skin called eruptive xanthomas. these fat deposits most commonly appear on the trunk, buttocks, knees, and arms. eruptive xanthomas are small (about 1 millimeter in diameter), but individual xanthomas can cluster together to form larger patches. they are generally not painful unless exposed to repeated friction or abrasion. eruptive xanthomas begin to appear when fat intake increases and levels rise; the deposits disappear when fat intake slows and levels decrease.  the blood of people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency can have a milky appearance due to its high fat content. when fat levels get very high in people with this condition, fats can accumulate in blood vessels in the tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). the fat buildup gives this tissue a pale pink appearance when examined (lipemia retinalis). this fat accumulation does not affect vision and will disappear once fats from the diet are reduced and levels in the body decrease.  in people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, increased fat levels can also cause neurological features, such as depression, memory loss, and mild intellectual decline (dementia). these problems are remedied when dietary fat levels normalize."
what are the treatments for central core disease ?,"what treatments might be available for central core disease? treatments for central core disease (ccd) depend on the symptoms experienced by each affected individual.  when someone is first diagnosed with this condition, a physical examination is done to assess the extent and severity of muscle weakness, and physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments to determine which therapies might be most beneficial.  physical therapy, such as stretching or low-impact exercises, may help improve weakness.  some skeletal abnormalities can be addressed with physical therapy, though others may require surgery.  as the muscle weakness and scoliosis associated with ccd can affect breathing, individuals diagnosed with this condition may benefit from pulmonary function tests.  if breathing is significantly affected, breathing exercises or other breathing support treatments may be recommended.  another treatment option may be a medication called salbutamol, which was found to significantly increased muscle strength and stamina in six of eight children with ccd."
what is the outlook for osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) is affected by certain factors before and after treatment.    the prognosis of untreated osteosarcoma and mfh depends on the following:         - where the tumor is in the body and whether tumors formed in more than one bone.    - the size of the tumor.    - whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and where it has spread.    - the type of tumor (based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope).    - the patient's age and weight at diagnosis.    - whether the tumor has caused a break in the bone.     - whether the patient has certain genetic diseases.        after osteosarcoma or mfh is treated, prognosis also depends on the following:         - how much of the cancer was killed by chemotherapy.    - how much of the tumor was taken out by surgery.    - whether chemotherapy is delayed for more than 3 weeks after surgery takes place.    - whether the cancer has recurred (come back) within 2 years of diagnosis.        treatment options for osteosarcoma and mfh depend on the following:         - where the tumor is in the body.    - the size of the tumor.    - the stage of the cancer.    - whether the bones are still growing.    - the patient's age and general health.    - the desire of the patient and family for the patient to be able to participate in activities such as sports or have a certain appearance.    - whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred after treatment."
what causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2 ?,"what causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2? researchers have identified more than a dozen grhpr mutations that cause this condition. these mutations either introduce signals that disrupt production of the glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase enzyme or alter its structure. as a result, enzyme activity is absent or dramatically reduced. glyoxylate builds up because of the enzyme shortage, and is converted to a compound called oxalate instead of glycolate. oxalate, in turn, combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, which the body cannot readily eliminate. deposits of calcium oxalate can lead to the characteristic features of primary hyperoxaluria type 2."

what are the genetic changes related to silver syndrome ?,"mutations in the bscl2 gene cause silver syndrome. the bscl2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called seipin, whose function is unknown. the bscl2 gene is active (expressed) in cells throughout the body, particularly in nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) and in brain cells. within cells, seipin is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport.  bscl2 gene mutations that cause silver syndrome likely lead to an alteration in the structure of seipin, causing it to fold into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. research findings indicate that misfolded seipin proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. this accumulation likely damages and kills motor neurons, which leads to muscle weakness and spasticity. in silver syndrome, only specific motor neurons are involved, resulting in the hand and leg muscles being solely affected.  some people with silver syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the bscl2 gene. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."

what is (are) childhood astrocytomas ?,"key points
                    - childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain.     - astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).    - the central nervous system controls many important body functions.    - the cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known.     - the signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child.     - tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood astrocytomas.     - childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain.
                    astrocytomas are tumors that start in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. an astrocyte is a type of glial cell. glial cells hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to them, and help protect them from disease, such as infection. gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells. an astrocytoma is a type of glioma.   astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children. it can form anywhere in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).    this summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain (primary brain tumors). metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain. treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here.    brain tumors can occur in both children and adults. however, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. see the following pdq summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults:          -  childhood brain and spinal cord tumors treatment overview     -  adult central nervous system tumors treatment
                
                
                    astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
                    benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. they rarely spread into other tissues. malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. when a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment.
                
                
                    the central nervous system controls many important body functions.
                    astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system (cns):         -   cerebrum : the largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. the cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.     -   cerebellum : the lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). the cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture.    -   brain stem : the part that connects the brain to the spinal cord, in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). the brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating.     -   hypothalamus : the area in the middle of the base of the brain. it controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst.    -  visual pathway: the group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain.    -  spinal cord: the column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. it is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. the spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch."

what are the genetic changes related to wilson disease ?,"wilson disease is caused by mutations in the atp7b gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting atpase 2, which plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. the copper-transporting atpase 2 protein is particularly important for the elimination of excess copper from the body. mutations in the atp7b gene prevent the transport protein from functioning properly. with a shortage of functional protein, excess copper is not removed from the body. as a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain.  research indicates that a normal variation in the prnp gene may modify the course of wilson disease. the prnp gene provides instructions for making prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and appears to be involved in transporting copper. studies have focused on the effects of a prnp gene variation that affects position 129 of the prion protein. at this position, people can have either the protein building block (amino acid) methionine or the amino acid valine. among people who have mutations in the atp7b gene, it appears that having methionine instead of valine at position 129 of the prion protein is associated with delayed onset of symptoms and an increased occurrence of neurological symptoms, particularly tremors. larger studies are needed, however, before the effects of this prnp gene variation on wilson disease can be established."
how to diagnose kidney stones in children ?,"the process of diagnosing any illness begins with consideration of the symptoms. pain or bloody urine may be the first symptom. urine, blood, and imaging tests will help determine whether symptoms are caused by a stone. urine tests can be used to check for infection and for substances that form stones. blood tests can be used to check for biochemical problems that can lead to kidney stones. various imaging techniques can be used to locate the stone:
                
- ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. an abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show the location of any stones. this test does not expose children to radiation, unlike some other imaging tests. although other tests are more useful in detecting very small stones or stones in the lower portion of the ureter, ultrasound is considered by many health care providers to be the best screening test to look for stones.  - computerized tomography (ct) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create threedimensional (3-d) images. a ct scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the child to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. ct scans may be required to get an accurate stone count when children are being considered for urologic surgery. because ct scans expose children to a moderate amount of radiation, health care providers try to reduce radiation exposure in children by avoiding repeated ct scans, restricting the area scanned as much as possible, and using the lowest radiation dose that will provide the needed diagnostic information.  - x-ray machines use radiation to create images of the childs urinary tract. the images can be taken at an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. the x rays are used to locate many kinds of stones. a conventional x ray is generally less informative than an ultrasound or ct scan, but it is less expensive and can be done more quickly than other imaging procedures."
what are the genetic changes related to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease ?,"the primary genetic cause of pvod is mutations in the eif2ak4 gene. mutations in other genes may cause a small percentage of cases. other suspected causes of pvod include viral infection and exposure to toxic chemicals, including certain chemotherapy drugs.  the protein produced from the eif2ak4 gene helps cells respond appropriately to changes that could damage the cell. for example, when the level of protein building blocks (amino acids) in a cell falls too low, the activity of the eif2ak4 protein helps reduce the production of other proteins, which conserves amino acids. the eif2ak4 gene mutations involved in pvod likely eliminate functional eif2ak4 protein; however, it is unknown how absence of this protein's function leads to the pulmonary vessel abnormalities that underlie pvod."
what are the symptoms of brody myopathy ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of brody myopathy? symptoms of brody disease typically begin in childhood. children with this condition may have a hard time keeping up with their peers in physical activities. they have a difficult time relaxing muscles, first in their arms and legs, but then in their face and trunk. they may also have difficulty relaxing their eyelids and grip. these muscle symptoms worsen with exercise and exposure to cold weather. in people with brody disease, the term pseudomyotonia is used to describe these muscle symptoms. the term myotonia refers to muscle stiffness or an inability to relax the muscles and can be evidenced by abnormal electromyography (emg) results. in brody disease the emg results are normal, even though the person show signs of the muscle stiffness. because of the normal emg results, the word pseudo-myotonia is used. in addition to the pseudomyotonia, people with brody disease sometimes develop myoglobinuria. myoglobinuria is the abnormal breakdown of the muscle protein, myoglobin. click here to learn more about testing for myoglobinuria. people with brody disease do not tend to have percussion myotonia. a doctor may test for percussion myotonia by mildly tapping on a muscle and watching how the muscle responds. percussion myotonia is a symptom in other muscle disorders. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for brody myopathy. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) autosomal recessive inheritance - muscle cramps - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) familial dilated cardiomyopathy ?,"familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease. it occurs when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes stretched out in at least one chamber of the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated). as a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. eventually, all four chambers of the heart become dilated as the cardiac muscle tries to increase the amount of blood being pumped through the heart. however, as the cardiac muscle becomes increasingly thin and weakened, it is less able to pump blood. over time, this condition results in heart failure.  it usually takes many years for symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy to appear. they typically begin in mid-adulthood, but can occur at any time from infancy to late adulthood. signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), extreme tiredness (fatigue), fainting episodes (syncope), and swelling of the legs and feet. in some cases, the first sign of the disorder is sudden cardiac death. the severity of the condition varies among affected individuals, even in members of the same family."
how to diagnose pigmented villonodular synovitis ?,"how is pigmented villonodular synovitis diagnosed? pigmented villonodular synovitis (pvns) is diagnosed via physician examination, imaging studies, and sometimes surgical procedures. imaging studies commonly used include: x-ray, mri, and ct scan. mri findings are diagnostic in more than 95% of patients. ct scan findings are additionally often diagnostic, though they might not show the extent of the disease. other methods that might be utilized in the diagnostic process include joint aspiration, in which a needle is used to remove fluid from the joint and a biopsy, in which a small operation is completed to obtain a tissue sample."
is currarino triad inherited ?,"how is currarino triad inherited? currarino triad is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the mnx1 gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. in other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. this is called a de novo mutation. when a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. a significant interfamilial (between different families) and intrafamilial (within the same family) variability in expression has been found without any definite correlation to the genetic mutations. this means in one family, a parent might only have one very mild feature of currarino triad while one of their children might have severe forms of all three features and yet another child might have a mild form of one feature and a severe form of another."

                    colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.
                    the colon is part of the body's digestive system. the digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. the digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. the colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long. the anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).       cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. cancer that affects either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer.   see the following pdq summaries for more information about colorectal cancer:         -  colorectal cancer screening     -  colon cancer treatment     -  rectal cancer treatment     -  genetics of colorectal cancer

                    the number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are both decreasing a little bit each year. however, in adults younger than 50 years, the number of new colorectal cancer cases has slowly increased since 1998. the number of new colorectal cancers and deaths from colorectal cancer are higher in african americans than in other races.   finding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer. screening tests may be used to help find colorectal cancer."
who is at risk for urinary tract infection in adults? ?,"although everyone has some risk, some people are more prone to getting utis than others. people with spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder have difficulty emptying their bladder completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the urine that stays in the bladder. anyone with an abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs the flow of urinea kidney stone or enlarged prostate, for exampleis at risk for a uti. people with diabetes or problems with the bodys natural defense system are more likely to get utis.
                
sexual activity can move microbes from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. if these microbes have special characteristics that allow them to live in the urinary tract, it is harder for the body to remove them quickly enough to prevent infection. following sexual intercourse, most women have a significant number of bacteria in their urine, but the body normally clears them within 24 hours. however, some forms of birth control increase the risk of uti. in some women, certain spermicides may irritate the skin, increasing the risk of bacteria invading surrounding tissues. using a diaphragm may slow urinary flow and allow bacteria to multiply. condom use is also associated with increased risk of utis, possibly because of the increased trauma that occurs to the vagina during sexual activity. using spermicides with diaphragms and condoms can increase risk even further.
                
another common source of infection is catheters, or tubes, placed in the urethra and bladder. catheters interfere with the bodys ability to clear microbes from the urinary tract. bacteria travel through or around the catheter and establish a place where they can thrive within the bladder. a person who cannot urinate in the normal way or who is unconscious or critically ill often needs a catheter for more than a few days. the infectious diseases society of america recommends using catheters for the shortest time possible to reduce the risk of a uti.3
                
recurrent infections
                
many women suffer from frequent utis. about 20 percent of young women with a first uti will have a recurrent infection.4 with each uti, the risk that a woman will continue having recurrent utis increases.5 some women have three or more utis a year. however, very few women will have frequent infections throughout their lives. more typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent infections, after which recurring infections cease.
                
men are less likely than women to have a first uti. but once a man has a uti, he is likely to have another because bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. anyone who has diabetes or a problem that makes it hard to urinate may have repeat infections.
                
research funded by the national institutes of health (nih) suggests that one factor behind recurrent utis may be the ability of bacteria to attach to cells lining the urinary tract. one nih-funded study found that bacteria formed a protective film on the inner lining of the bladder in mice.6 if a similar process can be demonstrated in humans, the discovery may lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent utis. another line of research has indicated that women who are nonsecretors of certain blood group antigens may be more prone to recurrent utis because the cells lining the vagina and urethra may allow bacteria to attach more easily. a nonsecretor is a person with an a, b, or ab blood type who does not secrete the normal antigens for that blood type in bodily fluids, such as fluids that line the bladder wall.7
                
infections during pregnancy
                
pregnant women seem no more prone to utis than other women. however, when a uti does occur in a pregnant woman, it is more likely to travel to the kidneys. according to some reports, about 4 to 5 percent of pregnant women develop a uti.8 scientists think that hormonal changes and shifts in the position of the urinary tract during pregnancy make it easier for bacteria to travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause infection. for this reason, health care providers routinely screen pregnant women for bacteria in the urine during the first 3 months of pregnancy."
what is (are) 22q11.2 duplication syndrome ?,"22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a condition caused by an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 22 which contains about 30 to 40 genes. the features of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same family (intrafamilial variability). affected individuals may have intellectual or learning disability, developmental delay, slow growth leading to short stature, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). many people with the condition have no apparent physical or intellectual disabilities. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with about 70% genes of affected individuals inheriting the condition from a parent. in other cases it occurs as a de novo mutation (new genetic change) in an individual; however, individuals with a de novo mutation can can pass the duplication to their children. researchers are working to determine which duplicated genes may contribute to the developmental delay and other problems that sometimes affect people with this condition. duplication is not detectable by karyotype and most of the people with 22q11.2 duplication syndrome are identified by a special technique known as chromosomal microarray. treatment depends on the symptoms and includes an individualized educational program. read more out chromosome 22."

what are the genetic changes related to optic atrophy type 1 ?,"optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the opa1 gene. the protein produced from this gene is made in many types of cells and tissues throughout the body. the opa1 protein is found inside mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. the opa1 protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). the opa1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the small amount of dna within mitochondria, called mitochondrial dna (mtdna).  mutations in the opa1 gene lead to overall dysfunction of mitochondria. the structure of the mitochondria become disorganized and cells are more susceptible to self-destruction. opa1 gene mutations lead to mitochondria with reduced energy-producing capabilities. the maintenance of mtdna is also sometimes impaired, resulting in mtdna mutations.  the vision problems experienced by people with optic atrophy type 1 are due to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the breakdown of structures that transmit visual information from the eyes to the brain. affected individuals first experience a progressive loss of nerve cells within the retina, called retinal ganglion cells. the loss of these cells is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerve. the optic nerve is partly made up of specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells called axons; when the retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerve cannot transmit visual information to the brain normally.  it is unclear why the opa1 gene mutations that cause optic atrophy type 1 only affect the eyes. retinal ganglion cells have many mitochondria and especially high energy requirements, which researchers believe may make them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases in energy production.  some individuals with optic atrophy type 1 do not have identified mutations in the opa1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

what is (are) aceruloplasminemia ?,"aceruloplasminemia is a disorder in which iron gradually accumulates in the brain and other organs. iron accumulation in the brain results in neurological problems that generally appear in adulthood and worsen over time.  people with aceruloplasminemia develop a variety of movement problems. they may experience involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia) of the head and neck, resulting in repetitive movements and contortions. other involuntary movements may also occur, such as rhythmic shaking (tremors), jerking movements (chorea), eyelid twitching (blepharospasm), and grimacing. affected individuals may also have difficulty with coordination (ataxia). some develop psychiatric problems and a decline of intellectual function (dementia) in their forties or fifties.  in addition to neurological problems, affected individuals may have diabetes mellitus caused by iron damage to cells in the pancreas that make insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. iron accumulation in the pancreas reduces the cells' ability to make insulin, which impairs blood sugar regulation and leads to the signs and symptoms of diabetes.  iron accumulation in the tissues and organs results in a corresponding shortage (deficiency) of iron in the blood, leading to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). anemia and diabetes usually occur by the time an affected person is in his or her twenties.  affected individuals also have changes in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina) caused by excess iron. the changes result in small opaque spots and areas of tissue degeneration (atrophy) around the edges of the retina. these abnormalities usually do not affect vision but can be observed during an eye examination.  the specific features of aceruloplasminemia and their severity may vary, even within the same family."
what is (are) choroideremia ?,"choroideremia is a genetic condition that causes vision loss. this disorder typically affects males. the first symptom is usually impairment of night vision (night blindness), which can occur in childhood. people with this disorder also experience narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity). the vision problems are due to loss of cells in the retina (light sensitive part of the eye) and choroid (blood vessels in the eye). the vision issues tend to get worse over time and usually lead to blindness in late adulthood. the rate and degree of vision loss differs for each person. choroideremia is caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in the chm gene and is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern."
what are the symptoms of andersen-tawil syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of andersen-tawil syndrome? anderson-tawil syndrome causes episodes of muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and developmental abnormalities. the most common changes affecting the heart are ventricular arrhythmia, which is a disruption in the rhythm of the heart's lower chambers, and long qt syndrome. long qt syndrome is a heart condition that causes the heart muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. if untreated, the irregular heartbeats can lead to discomfort, fainting, or cardiac arrest. physical abnormalities associated with andersen-tawil syndrome typically affect the head, face, and limbs. these features often include a very small lower jaw (micrognathia), dental abnormalities, low-set ears, widely spaced eyes, and unusual curving of the fingers or toes (clinodactyly). some affected people also have short stature and an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for andersen-tawil syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) specific learning disability 7.5% antegonial notching of mandible - autosomal dominant inheritance - bidirectional ventricular ectopy - blepharophimosis - brachydactyly syndrome - broad forehead - bulbous nose - cleft palate - clinodactyly of the 5th finger - clinodactyly of the 5th toe - delayed eruption of permanent teeth - delayed skeletal maturation - facial asymmetry - growth abnormality - high palate - hypertelorism - hypoplasia of dental enamel - hypoplasia of the maxilla - joint laxity - low-set ears - malar flattening - microcephaly - oligodontia - palpitations - periodic hypokalemic paresis - persistence of primary teeth - preauricular pit - prolonged qt interval - prominent frontal sinuses - scapular winging - scoliosis - short foot - short mandibular rami - short metacarpal - short metatarsal - short palm - short palpebral fissure - short phalanx of finger - slender long bone - small hand - syncope - toe syndactyly - triangular face - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) mumps ?,"mumps is an illness caused by the mumps virus. it starts with       - fever    - headache    - muscle aches    - tiredness    - loss of appetite       after that, the salivary glands under the ears or jaw become swollen and tender. the swelling can be on one or both sides of the face. symptoms last 7 to 10 days. serious complications are rare.    you can catch mumps by being with another person who has it. there is no treatment for mumps, but the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine can prevent it.    before the routine vaccination program in the united states, mumps was a common illness in infants, children and young adults. now it is a rare disease in the u.s.    centers for disease control and prevention"
is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis inherited ?,"is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) inherited? about 90-95% percent of cases of als are not inherited and occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family. the remaining 5-10% of cases are familial, and are thought to be caused by mutations in any one of several genes. the inheritance pattern associated with familial als varies depending on the disease-causing gene involved. most familial cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that only one altered (mutated) copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in most of these cases, an affected individual has one parent with the condition. when an individual with an autosomal dominant form of als has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherited the mutated copy of the gene and be affected. less frequently, als is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. in autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the disease-causing gene (typically one copy inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for the individual to be affected. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition, who presumably each carry one mutated copy of the gene, are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers for the same condition are having children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier. autosomal recessive forms of als may be mistaken for non-inherited (sporadic) forms due to having a negative family history of the condition. in rare cases, als is inherited in an x-linked dominant manner. this occurs when the disease-causing gene is located on the x chromosome (a sex chromosome). although females have 2 x chromosomes, having a mutation in one x chromosome is still sufficient to cause the condition. males who have a mutation (and only one x chromosome) will have the condition. usually, males with an x-linked dominant form of als experience more severe symptoms than females with the same form. some individuals who do inherit a mutation known to cause als never develop signs and symptoms of als, although the reason for this is unclear. this phenomenon is referred to as reduced penetrance."
what are the genetic changes related to argininosuccinic aciduria ?,"mutations in the asl gene cause argininosuccinic aciduria.  argininosuccinic aciduria belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. the urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occur in liver cells. it processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys.  in argininosuccinic aciduria, the enzyme that starts a specific reaction within the urea cycle is damaged or missing. the urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia.  ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so argininosuccinic aciduria causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver."

what is (are) autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ?,"autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (adpeaf) is a rare form of epilepsy, a condition that is characterized by recurrent seizures. in adpeaf, specifically, most affected people experience secondary generalized seizures and partial seizures, some of which are associated with sound-related symptoms (such as buzzing, humming, or ringing) and/or receptive aphasia (inability to understand written or spoken words). less commonly, seizures may cause visual hallucinations, a disturbance in the sense of smell, vertigo, or other symptoms affecting the senses. signs and symptoms of the condition generally begin in adolescence or early adulthood. adpeaf is caused by changes (mutations) in the lgi1 or reln gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. the seizures associated with adpeaf are typically well controlled with medications that are used to treat epilepsy (called antiepileptic drugs)."
what are the genetic changes related to hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome ?,"mutations in the cdc73 gene (also known as the hrpt2 gene) cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. the cdc73 gene provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. this protein is found throughout the body and is likely involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. parafibromin is also thought to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), either promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation depending on signals within the cell.  cdc73 gene mutations cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome by reducing the amount of functional parafibromin that is produced. most of these mutations result in a parafibromin protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. without functional parafibromin, cell proliferation is not properly regulated. uncontrolled cell division can lead to the formation of tumors. it is unknown why only certain tissues seem to be affected by changes in parafibromin.  some people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome do not have identified mutations in the cdc73 gene. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."
is 3mc syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) niemann-pick disease ?,"niemann-pick disease is a condition that affects many body systems. it has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity. niemann-pick disease is divided into four main types: type a, type b, type c1, and type c2. these types are classified on the basis of genetic cause and the signs and symptoms of the condition.  infants with niemann-pick disease type a usually develop an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) by age 3 months and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). the affected children develop normally until around age 1 year when they experience a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement (psychomotor regression). children with niemann-pick disease type a also develop widespread lung damage (interstitial lung disease) that can cause recurrent lung infections and eventually lead to respiratory failure. all affected children have an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination. children with niemann-pick disease type a generally do not survive past early childhood.  niemann-pick disease type b usually presents in mid-childhood. the signs and symptoms of this type are similar to type a, but not as severe. people with niemann-pick disease type b often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). they also have short stature and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age). about one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality or neurological impairment. people with niemann-pick disease type b usually survive into adulthood.  the signs and symptoms of niemann-pick disease types c1 and c2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. niemann-pick disease types c1 and c2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. people with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (dystonia), severe liver disease, and interstitial lung disease. individuals with niemann-pick disease types c1 and c2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. affected individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have seizures. people with these types may survive into adulthood."
what are the treatments for weill-marchesani syndrome ?,"how might weill-marchesani syndrome be treated? there is no cure for weill-marchesani syndrome, and treatment focuses addressing the symptoms that develop. individuals with this condition often need a team of medical specialists, including pediatricians, eye specialists (ophthalmologists and optometrists), orthopedists, and cardiologists. regular eye exams are important for early diagnosis of eye problems. corrective glasses, visual aids, or eye surgery may be needed to improve vision. increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) may be treated with eye drops, laser therapy, surgical removal of the iris or lens. contraction or dilation of the pupils can cause glaucoma in some people with weill-marchesani syndrome. medications that contract the pupil must be avoided, and medications that dilate the pupils must be given with care. joint stiffness and bone abnormalities can cause complications if anesthesia is needed for a procedure. it is important to inform a physician of the diagnosis before receiving anesthesia, as it can impact airway management."
what are the treatments for cadasil ?,"how might cadasil be treated? there is currently no treatment for cadasil that is proven to be effective. while antiplatelet treatment is often used, it is also not proven to be useful. migraine should be treated both symptomatically and prophylactically (with preventative methods), depending on the frequency of symptoms. when hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) are also present, they should be treated. supportive care, including practical help, emotional support, and counseling, is useful for affected people and their families. smoking increases the risk of stroke, so affected people who smoke should quit."
what is (are) hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum ?,"hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (h-abc) is a disease that affects certain parts of the brain.  symptoms usually begin in infancy or early childhood and vary in severity; they include movement difficulties and delay in mental development or learning problems.  these symptoms occur because certain brain cells in individuals with h-abc are not fully covered by myelin (hypomyelination), a substance that usually surrounds nerve cells to help them work better.  also, this condition causes the breakdown (atrophy) of two parts of the brain that help to coordinate movement - the basal ganglia and cerebellum.  h-abc is is caused by a mutation in the tubb4a gene."

how to diagnose high blood pressure and kidney disease ?,"a health care provider diagnoses high blood pressure when multiple blood pressure testsoften repeated over several visits to a health care providers officeshow that a systolic blood pressure is consistently above 140 or a diastolic blood pressure is consistently above 90. health care providers measure blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff. people can also buy blood pressure cuffs at discount chain stores and drugstores to monitor their blood pressure at home.
                
kidney disease is diagnosed with urine and blood tests.
                
urine tests
                
dipstick test for albumin. a dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine. albumin is a protein in the blood that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. a patient collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. the office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for analysis. for the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein is present in urine.
                
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. a health care provider uses the albumin and creatinine measurement to determine the ratio between the albumin and creatinine in the urine. creatinine is a waste product in the blood that is filtered in the kidneys and excreted in the urine. a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 mg/g may be a sign of kidney disease.

a blood test involves having blood drawn at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. a health care provider may order a blood test to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr). the results of the test indicate the following:
                
- egfr of 60 or above is in the normal range  - egfr below 60 may indicate kidney damage  - egfr of 15 or below may indicate kidney failure
                

                
get screened for kidney disease   kidney disease, when found early, can be treated to prevent more serious disease and other complications. the national kidney foundation recommends people with high blood pressure receive the following regular screenings:   - blood pressure tests   - urine albumin   - egfr    health care providers will help determine how often people with high blood pressure should be screened."
what is (are) dolk-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?,"dolk-congenital disorder of glycosylation (dolk-cdg, formerly known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type im) is an inherited condition that often affects the heart but can also involve other body systems. the pattern and severity of this disorder's signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  individuals with dolk-cdg typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy or early childhood. nearly all individuals with dolk-cdg develop a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy). other frequent signs and symptoms include recurrent seizures; developmental delay; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). less commonly, affected individuals can have distinctive facial features, kidney disease, hormonal abnormalities, or eye problems.  individuals with dolk-cdg typically do not survive into adulthood, often because of complications related to dilated cardiomyopathy, and some do not survive past infancy."
what is (are) lysinuric protein intolerance ?,"lysinuric protein intolerance is a disorder caused by the body's inability to digest and use certain protein building blocks (amino acids), namely lysine, arginine, and ornithine. because the body cannot effectively break down these amino acids, which are found in many protein-rich foods, nausea and vomiting are typically experienced after ingesting protein.  people with lysinuric protein intolerance have features associated with protein intolerance, including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and progressively brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis). a lung disorder called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may also develop. this disorder is characterized by protein deposits in the lungs, which interfere with lung function and can be life-threatening. an accumulation of amino acids in the kidneys can cause end-stage renal disease (esrd) in which the kidneys become unable to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. a lack of certain amino acids can cause elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. if ammonia levels are too high for too long, they can cause coma and intellectual disability.  the signs and symptoms of lysinuric protein intolerance typically appear after infants are weaned and receive greater amounts of protein from solid foods."
what are the symptoms of leukoplakia ?,"what are the early signs of cancer in vulvar leukoplakia? early signs of cancer may not be apparent. the clinical appearance of leukoplakia does not generally correlate with its appearance when examined under a microscope. for example, the lesion may appear unchanged for a period of time but may actually show changes when looked at under a microscope. therefore, a biopsy is typically recommended in all cases to determine which lesions are precancerous. small lesions may be biopsied and just followed periodically if it is shown to remain benign. however, those that show precancerous or cancerous features should be removed."
how to diagnose hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome ?,"how is hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (huv) diagnosed? what kind of tests are required? a diagnosis of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (huv) syndrome is supported by findings from varied tests, such as skin biopsy, blood tests, physical and eye examinations, and urinalysis and kidney imaging studies (when glomerulonephritis is suspected).  people with huv syndrome have hives (urticaria) for at least six months and low levels of proteins (complement) in the blood. complement levels can be determined through a blood test. click here to visit the american association for clinical chemistry's web site lab tests online to learn more about this test.  in addition to these major criteria, people with huv syndrome must also have at least two of the following minor criteria: inflammation in the small veins of the dermis (diagnosed by biopsy) joint pain or arthritis mild glomerulonephritis inflammation in the eye (uvea or episclera) recurrent abdominal pain the presence of anti-c1q antibodies (this test is not widely available) some people have urticarial vasculitis and low complement levels (hypocomplementemia), but do not meet diagnostic criteria for huv syndrome. these individuals may be diagnosed as having huv (where symptoms are limited to the skin), versus huv syndrome. differential diagnoses for huv syndrome include, schnitzler's syndrome, cogan's syndrome, and muckle-wells syndrome."
what are the symptoms of hairy elbows ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of hairy elbows? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for hairy elbows. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the elbow 90% abnormality of the mandible 90% hypertrichosis 90% micromelia 90% short stature 90% facial asymmetry 50% neurological speech impairment 50% round face 50% abnormality of the neck 7.5% cognitive impairment 7.5% delayed skeletal maturation 7.5% high forehead 7.5% joint hypermobility 7.5% microcephaly 7.5% prominent nasal bridge 7.5% ptosis 7.5% thick eyebrow 7.5% autosomal dominant inheritance - elbow hypertrichosis - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what causes osteoarthritis ?,"risk increases with age researchers suspect that osteoarthritis is caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. the chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. it is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. wear and tear on joints affects cartilage osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. this wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. putting too much stress on a joint that has been previously injured, improper alignment of joints, and excess weight all may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis."
is megdel syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the symptoms of carotid artery disease ?,"carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until it severely narrows or blocks a carotid artery. signs and symptoms may include a bruit, a transient ischemic attack(tia), or a stroke.
                
bruit
                
during a physical exam, your doctor may listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. he or she may hear a whooshing sound called a bruit. this sound may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup. to find out more, your doctor may recommend tests.
                
not all people who have carotid artery disease have bruits.
                
transient ischemic attack (mini-stroke)
                
for some people, having a transient ischemic attack (tia), or mini-stroke, is the first sign of carotid artery disease. during a mini-stroke, you may have some or all of the symptoms of a stroke. however, the symptoms usually go away on their own within 24 hours.
                
stroke and mini-stroke symptoms may include:
                
a sudden, severe headache with no known cause
                
dizziness or loss of balance
                
inability to move one or more of your limbs
                
sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
                
sudden weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, often on just one side of the body
                
trouble speaking or understanding speech
                
even if the symptoms stop quickly, call 911 for emergency help. do not drive yourself to the hospital. its important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible.
                
a mini-stroke is a warning sign that youre at high risk of having a stroke. you shouldnt ignore these symptoms. getting medical care can help find possible causes of a mini-stroke and help you manage risk factors. these actions might prevent a future stroke.
                
although a mini-stroke may warn of a stroke, it doesnt predict when a stroke will happen. a stroke may occur days, weeks, or even months after a mini-stroke.
                
stroke
                
the symptoms of a stroke are the same as those of a mini-stroke, but the results are not. a stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death. most people who have strokes have not previously had warning mini-strokes.
                
getting treatment for a stroke right away is very important. you have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. the sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery.
                
call 911 for emergency help as soon as symptoms occur. do not drive yourself to the hospital. its very important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible.
                
make those close to you aware of stroke symptoms and the need for urgent action. learning the signs and symptoms of a stroke will allow you to help yourself or someone close to you lower the risk of brain damage or death due to a stroke."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for fibromuscular dysplasia ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), a component of the national institutes of health (nih) within the u.s. department of health and human services, is the nations primary funding source for research on the brain and nervous system. the ninds conducts research on stroke and vascular lesions of the nervous system and supports studies through grants to medical institutions across the country."
what is (are) spinal cord infarction ?,"spinal cord infarction is a stroke either within the spinal cord or the arteries that supply it. it is caused by arteriosclerosis or a thickening or closing of the major arteries to the spinal cord. frequently spinal cord infarction is caused by a specific form of arteriosclerosis called atheromatosis, in which a deposit or accumulation of lipid-containing matter forms within the arteries. symptoms, which generally appear within minutes or a few hours of the infarction, may include intermittent sharp or burning back pain, aching pain down through the legs, weakness in the legs, paralysis, loss of deep tendon reflexes, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and incontinence."
what are the treatments for stroke ?,"generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual's underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. the most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics."
what is (are) x-linked infantile spasm syndrome ?,"x-linked infantile spasm syndrome is a seizure disorder characterized by a type of seizure known as infantile spasms. the spasms usually appear before the age of 1. several types of spasms have been described, but the most commonly reported involves bending at the waist and neck with extension of the arms and legs (sometimes called a jackknife spasm). each spasm lasts only seconds, but they occur in clusters several minutes long. although individuals are not usually affected while they are sleeping, the spasms commonly occur just after awakening. infantile spasms usually disappear by age 5, but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives.  most babies with x-linked infantile spasm syndrome have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram (eeg), a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. the eeg of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia, and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures.  because of the recurrent seizures, babies with x-linked infantile spasm syndrome stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired (developmental regression), such as sitting, rolling over, and babbling. subsequently, development in affected children is delayed. most affected individuals also have intellectual disability throughout their lives."
what is (are) gallstones ?,"your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. it stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. as your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. the duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.    your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. that is usually a gallstone. gallstones form when substances in bile harden. gallstone attacks usually happen after you eat. signs of a gallstone attack may include nausea, vomiting, or pain in the abdomen, back, or just under the right arm.    gallstones are most common among older adults, women, overweight people, native americans and mexican americans.    gallstones are often found during imaging tests for other health conditions. if you do not have symptoms, you usually do not need treatment. the most common treatment is removal of the gallbladder. fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder. bile has other ways to reach your small intestine.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what are the complications of cirrhosis ?,"as the liver fails, complications may develop. in some people, complications may be the first signs of the disease. complications of cirrhosis may include the following:
                
portal hypertension. the portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. in cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. this condition is called portal hypertension. portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis. this condition may lead to other complications, such as
                
- fluid buildup leading to edema and ascites  - enlarged blood vessels, called varices, in the esophagus, stomach, or both  - an enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly  - mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver, a condition called hepatic encephalopathy
                
edema and ascites. liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites. ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention.
                
varices. portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or both. these enlarged blood vessels, called esophageal or gastric varices, cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase, making the blood vessels more likely to burst. if they burst, serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach, requiring immediate medical attention.
                
splenomegaly. portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets, reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood. a low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis.
                
hepatic encephalopathy. a failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood, so they eventually accumulate in the brain. the buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy. this condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma. stupor is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus, such as a sharp pain. coma is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused. signs of decreased mental function include
                
- confusion  - personality changes  - memory loss  - trouble concentrating  - a change in sleep habits
                
metabolic bone diseases. some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease, which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin d, bone mass, bone structure, or minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous. osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker. when bone loss becomes more severe, the condition is referred to as osteoporosis. people with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures.
                
gallstones and bile duct stones. if cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder, the bile hardens into gallstones. symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts. stones may also form in and block the bile ducts, causing pain, jaundice, and bacterial cholangitis.
                
bruising and bleeding. when the liver slows the production of or stops producing the proteins needed for blood clotting, a person will bruise or bleed easily.
                
sensitivity to medications. cirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. when this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. for example, some pain medications may have a stronger effect or produce more side effects in people with cirrhosis than in people with a healthy liver.
                
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. cirrhosis causes resistance to insulin. the pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more; however, extra glucose builds up in the bloodstream, causing type 2 diabetes.
                
liver cancer. liver cancer is common in people with cirrhosis. liver cancer has a high mortality rate. current treatments are limited and only fully successful if a health care provider detects the cancer early, before the tumor is too large. for this reason, health care providers should check people with cirrhosis for signs of liver cancer every 6 to 12 months. health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to check for signs of liver cancer.
                
other complications. cirrhosis can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to an increased chance of infection. cirrhosis can also cause kidney and lung failure, known as hepatorenal and hepatopulmonary syndromes."

what are the treatments for renal nutcracker syndrome ?,"how might renal nutcracker syndrome be treated? treatment of renal nutcracker syndrome is based on severity of symptoms and their expected reversibility when considering the affected person's age and stage of the syndrome. adults with mild cases and affected children may be treated conservatively with regular surveillance. people younger than 18 years, specifically, are often observed for at least 2 years because as many as 75% will have complete resolution of symptoms without any significant intervention. ace inhibitors may be effective in treating orthostatic proteinuria. in those with severe symptoms who do not respond to more conservative treatments, surgery is often recommended."
what are the symptoms of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2f ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2f? the subtypes of charcot-marie-tooth type 2, including type 2f, have similar signs and symptoms. affected individuals usually become symptomatic between the ages of 5 and 25, though onset can range from infancy to after the third decade of life. the most common first symptom is weakness of the feet and ankles, followed by slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of distal muscles in the feet and/or hands. individuals often have decreased tendon reflexes and mild or no sensory loss. adults with cmt2 often have bilateral foot drop, symmetric atrophy of muscles below the knee (stork leg appearance) and absent tendon reflexes in the legs. mild sensory deficits of position, vibration, pain or temperature may occur in the feet, or sensation may be intact. pain (especially in the feet) is reported by about 20%-40% of affected individuals. other features that may be associated with cmt2 in a few individuals include hearing impairment; vocal cord or phrenic nerve involvement (which may result in difficulty with speech or breathing); restless legs; and sleep apnea. cmt2 is progressive over many years, but affected individuals often experience long periods without obvious progression. in some individuals, the condition may be so mild that it goes unrecognized. affected individuals have a normal life span. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2f. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) areflexia - autosomal dominant inheritance - chronic axonal neuropathy - decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - distal amyotrophy - distal muscle weakness - distal sensory impairment - fasciculations - foot dorsiflexor weakness - hyporeflexia - muscle cramps - pes cavus - steppage gait - ulnar claw - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to crouzon syndrome ?,"mutations in the fgfr2 gene cause crouzon syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. among its multiple functions, this protein signals immature cells to become bone cells during embryonic development. mutations in the fgfr2 gene probably overstimulate signaling by the fgfr2 protein, which causes the bones of the skull to fuse prematurely."
what is (are) child abuse ?,"child abuse is doing something or failing to do something that results in harm to a child or puts a child at risk of harm. child abuse can be physical, sexual or emotional. neglect, or not providing for a child's needs, is also a form of abuse.     most abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. an abused child may become depressed. he or she may withdraw, think of suicide or become violent. an older child may use drugs or alcohol, try to run away or abuse others.     child abuse is a serious problem. if you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, call the police or your local child welfare agency."
what are the treatments for osteoporosis ?,"several medications are approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of osteoporosis. since all medications have side effects, it is important to talk to your doctor about which medication is right for you. bisphosphonates. several bisphosphonates are approved for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. these medications reduce the activity of cells that cause bone loss. - side effects of taking oral bisphosphonates may include nausea, heartburn, and stomach pain, including serious digestive problems if they are not taken properly. side effects of taking oral bisphosphonates may include nausea, heartburn, and stomach pain, including serious digestive problems if they are not taken properly. - a few people have muscle, bone, or joint pain while using these medicines.  a few people have muscle, bone, or joint pain while using these medicines. -  side effects of intravenous bisphosphonates may include flu-like symptoms such as fever, pain in muscles or joints, and headaches. these symptoms usually stop after a few days. in rare cases, deterioration of the jawbone or an unusual type of broken bone in the femur (thigh bone) has occurred in people taking bisphosphonates.  side effects of intravenous bisphosphonates may include flu-like symptoms such as fever, pain in muscles or joints, and headaches. these symptoms usually stop after a few days. in rare cases, deterioration of the jawbone or an unusual type of broken bone in the femur (thigh bone) has occurred in people taking bisphosphonates. - the food and drug administration recommends that health care professionals consider periodic reevaluation of the need for continued bisphosphonate therapy, particularly for patients who have been on bisphosphonates for longer than 5 years. the food and drug administration recommends that health care professionals consider periodic reevaluation of the need for continued bisphosphonate therapy, particularly for patients who have been on bisphosphonates for longer than 5 years. parathyroid hormone. a form of human parathyroid hormone (pth) is approved for postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis who are at high risk for having a fracture. use of the drug for more than 2 years is not recommended.  rank ligand (rankl) inhibitor. a rank ligand (rankl) inhibitor is approved for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture estrogen agonists/antagonists. an estrogen agonist/ antagonist (also called a selective estrogen receptor modulator or serm) is approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. serms are not estrogens, but they have estrogen-like effects on some tissues and estrogen-blocking effects on other tissues. calcitonin. calcitonin is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in women who are at least 5 years beyond menopause. calcitonin is a hormone involved in calcium regulation and bone metabolism. estrogen and hormone therapy. estrogen is approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis in women after menopause. - because of recent evidence that breast cancer, strokes, blood clots, and heart attacks may be increased in some women who take estrogen, the food and drug administration recommends that women take the lowest effective dose for the shortest period possible. estrogen should only be considered for women at significant risk for osteoporosis, and nonestrogen medications should be carefully considered first. because of recent evidence that breast cancer, strokes, blood clots, and heart attacks may be increased in some women who take estrogen, the food and drug administration recommends that women take the lowest effective dose for the shortest period possible. estrogen should only be considered for women at significant risk for osteoporosis, and nonestrogen medications should be carefully considered first."

what are the genetic changes related to cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase deficiency ?,"cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase deficiency is caused by mutations in the por gene. this gene provides instructions for making the enzyme cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the formation of steroid hormones. this group of hormones includes testosterone and estrogen, which are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction; corticosteroids, which are involved in the body's response to stress; and aldosterone, which helps regulate the body's salt and water balance.  mutations in the por gene reduce the activity of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase, which disrupts the production of steroid hormones. changes in sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen lead to problems with sexual development before birth and at puberty. in a woman who is pregnant with an affected fetus, abnormal levels of sex hormones in the fetus may cause her to have mild, temporary signs and symptoms of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase deficiency.  cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase is also needed for the production of cholesterol. this substance has many essential functions both before and after birth, including roles in the production of steroid hormones and in the formation and growth of bones. mutations in the por gene can disrupt the production of cholesterol, which likely impairs normal bone formation in the severe form of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase deficiency. studies suggest that a molecule called retinoic acid also plays a role in the skeletal abnormalities found in severe cases. the breakdown of retinoic acid requires cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase; if a shortage of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase prevents retinoic acid from being broken down, the resulting excess of that molecule can stimulate the abnormal growth and fusion of bones.  the skeletal abnormalities found in the severe form of this disorder can also result from mutations in another gene, fgfr2. some researchers use the name antley-bixler syndrome to describe these features, whether they are caused by mutations in the por gene or in the fgfr2 gene. others use the name antley-bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis for cases caused by por gene mutations, reserving the name antley-bixler syndrome for cases caused by fgfr2 gene mutations."

what causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia ?,"bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) develops as a result of an infant's lungs becoming irritated or inflamed.
                
the lungs of premature infants are fragile and often aren't fully developed. they can easily be irritated or injured within hours or days of birth. many factors can damage premature infants' lungs.
                
ventilation
                
newborns who have breathing problems or can't breathe on their own may need ventilator support. ventilators are machines that use pressure to blow air into the airways and lungs.
                
although ventilator support can help premature infants survive, the machine's pressure might irritate and harm the babies' lungs. for this reason, doctors only recommend ventilator support when necessary.
                
high levels of oxygen
                
newborns who have breathing problems might need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube). this treatment helps the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.
                
however, high levels of oxygen can inflame the lining of the lungs and injure the airways. also, high levels of oxygen can slow lung development in premature infants.
                
infections
                
infections can inflame the lungs. as a result, the airways narrow, which makes it harder for premature infants to breathe. lung infections also increase the babies' need for extra oxygen and breathing support.
                
heredity
                
studies show that heredity may play a role in causing bpd. more studies are needed to confirm this finding."
is aminoacylase 1 deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what are the symptoms of schimke immunoosseous dysplasia ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of schimke immunoosseous dysplasia? schimke immunoosseous dysplasia is characterized by short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system. in people with this condition, short stature is caused by flattened spinal bones (vertebrae), resulting in a shortened neck and trunk. adult height is typically between 3 and 5 feet. kidney (renal) disease often leads to life-threatening renal failure and end-stage renal disease (esrd). affected individuals also have a shortage of certain immune system cells called t cells. t cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. a shortage of t cells causes a person to be more susceptible to illness. other features frequently seen in people with this condition include an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis); darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), typically on the chest and back; and a broad nasal bridge with a rounded tip of the nose. less common signs and symptoms of schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia include an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis), reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia), migraine-like headaches, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), decreased numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), underdeveloped hip bones (hypoplastic pelvis), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), a lack of sperm (azoospermia) in males, and irregular menstruation in females. in severe cases, many signs of schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia can be present at birth. people with mild cases of this disorder may not develop signs or symptoms until late childhood.   the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for schimke immunoosseous dysplasia. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) anemia 90% cellular immunodeficiency 90% depressed nasal bridge 90% glomerulopathy 90% intrauterine growth retardation 90% lymphopenia 90% melanocytic nevus 90% microdontia 90% nephrotic syndrome 90% proteinuria 90% short neck 90% thrombocytopenia 90% cafe-au-lait spot 50% abnormal immunoglobulin level - abnormality of t cells - arteriosclerosis - astigmatism - autosomal recessive inheritance - bulbous nose - coarse hair - disproportionate short-trunk short stature - fine hair - focal segmental glomerulosclerosis - high pitched voice - hypermelanotic macule - hypertension - hypoplasia of the capital femoral epiphysis - lateral displacement of the femoral head - lumbar hyperlordosis - motor delay - myopia - neutropenia - opacification of the corneal stroma - osteopenia - ovoid vertebral bodies - platyspondyly - protuberant abdomen - recurrent infections - renal insufficiency - shallow acetabular fossae - spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia - thoracic kyphosis - thyroid-stimulating hormone excess - transient ischemic attack - waddling gait - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome ?,"craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, profound hearing loss, and hand abnormalities.  the distinctive facial features of people with craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome result from a variety of developmental abnormalities involving the skull (cranium) and face. affected individuals often have underdeveloped or absent nasal bones resulting in a small nose, thin nostrils, and a flattened mid-face with a flat nasal bridge. individuals with this condition typically also have widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), narrowed openings of the eyes (narrowed palpebral fissures), a small upper jaw (hypoplastic maxilla), and a small mouth with pursed lips.  people with this condition also have profound hearing loss that is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness). hearing loss in these individuals is present from birth.  in affected individuals, a common abnormality of the muscles in the hand is a malformation in which all of the fingers are angled outward toward the fifth finger (ulnar deviation). people with craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome may also have permanently bent third, fourth, and fifth fingers (camptodactyly), which can limit finger movement and lead to joint deformities called contractures. contractures in the wrist can further impair hand movements."
what is (are) immunotactoid glomerulopathy ?,"immunotactoid glomerulopathy, also known as glomerulonephritis with organized monoclonal microtubular immunoglobulin deposits (gommid),  is a very uncommon cause of glomerular disease. it is related to a similar disease known as fibrillary glomerulopathy, which is more common. both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins, but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). on electron microscopy, immunotactoid glomerulopathy is characterized by the formation of microtubules which are much larger than the fibrils observed in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (30 to 50 versus 16 to 24 nm in diameter). the signs and symptoms include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis c virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease. also, patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy have a greater risk to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia and b cell lymphomas and should be screened for all of these conditions. treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems."

how many people are affected by familial cylindromatosis ?,familial cylindromatosis is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
what is (are) freeman-sheldon syndrome ?,"freeman-sheldon syndrome is a condition that primarily affects the face, hands, and feet. people with this disorder have a distinctive facial appearance including a small mouth (microstomia) with pursed lips, giving the appearance of a ""whistling face."" for this reason, the condition is sometimes called ""whistling face syndrome.""  people with freeman-sheldon syndrome may also have a prominent forehead and brow ridges, a sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), a short nose, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), deep folds in the skin between the nose and lips (nasolabial folds), full cheeks, and a chin dimple shaped like an ""h"" or ""v"".  affected individuals may have a number of abnormalities that affect the eyes. these may include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), deep-set eyes, outside corners of the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).  other facial features that may occur in freeman-sheldon syndrome include an unusually small tongue (microglossia) and jaw (micrognathia) and a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate). people with this disorder may have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), a failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and respiratory complications that may be life-threatening. speech problems are also common in this disorder. some affected individuals have hearing loss.  freeman-sheldon syndrome is also characterized by joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement. people with this disorder typically have multiple contractures in the hands and feet at birth (distal arthrogryposis). these contractures lead to permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), a hand deformity in which all of the fingers are angled outward toward the fifth finger (ulnar deviation, also called ""windmill vane hand""), and inward- and downward-turning feet (clubfoot). affected individuals may also have a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).  people with freeman-sheldon syndrome also have an increased risk of developing a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other invasive procedures. this reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. malignant hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of pain. a particular type of muscle relaxant may also trigger the reaction. if given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening unless they are treated promptly.  intelligence is unaffected in most people with freeman-sheldon syndrome, but approximately one-third have some degree of intellectual disability."
what are the treatments for myasthenia gravis ?,"myasthenia gravis can be controlled. some medications improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength, and some suppress the production of abnormal antibodies. these medications must be used with careful medical follow up because they may cause major side effects. thymectomy, the surgical removal of the thymus gland (which often is abnormal in those with myasthenia gravis), improves symptoms in certain individuals other therapies include plasmapheresis, a procedure in which abnormal antibodies are removed from the blood, and high-dose intravenous immune globulin, which temporarily modifies the immune system and provides the body with normal antibodies from donated blood."
is noonan syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
who is at risk for overweight and obesity? ?,"being overweight or obese isn't a cosmetic problem. these conditions greatly raise your risk for other health problems.
                
overweight and obesity-related health problems in adults
                
coronary heart disease
                
as your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (chd). chd is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. these arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.
                
plaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. this can cause angina (an-ji-nuh or an-juh-nuh) or a heart attack. (angina is chest pain or discomfort.)
                
obesity also can lead to heart failure. this is a serious condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.
                
high blood pressure
                
blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. if this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.
                
your chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you're overweight or obese.
                
stroke
                
being overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form.
                
if the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. the risk of having a stroke rises as bmi increases.
                
type 2 diabetes
                
diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. the cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.
                
in type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly. at first, the body reacts by making more insulin. over time, however, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.
                
diabetes is a leading cause of early death, chd, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.
                
abnormal blood fats
                
if you're overweight or obese, you're at increased risk of having abnormal levels of blood fats. these include high levels of triglycerides and ldl (""bad"") cholesterol and low levels of hdl (""good"") cholesterol.
                
abnormal levels of these blood fats are a risk factor for chd. for more information about triglycerides and ldl and hdl cholesterol, go to the health topics high blood cholesterol article.
                
metabolic syndrome
                
metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.
                
you can develop any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:
                
a large waistline. this is called abdominal obesity or ""having an apple shape."" having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for chd than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.
                
a higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).
                
a lower than normal hdl cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low hdl cholesterol).
                
higher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).
                
higher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes).
                
cancer
                
being overweight or obese raises your risk for colon, breast, endometrial, and gallbladder cancers.
                
osteoarthritis
                
osteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back. the condition occurs if the tissue that protects the joints wears away. extra weight can put more pressure and wear on joints, causing pain.
                
sleep apnea
                
sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
                
a person who has sleep apnea may have more fat stored around the neck. this can narrow the airway, making it hard to breathe.
                
obesity hypoventilation syndrome
                
obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ohs) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. in ohs, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).
                
ohs can lead to serious health problems and may even cause death.
                
reproductive problems
                
obesity can cause menstrual issues and infertility in women.
                
gallstones
                
gallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in the gallbladder. they're mostly made of cholesterol. gallstones can cause stomach or back pain.
                
people who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of having gallstones. also, being overweight may result in an enlarged gallbladder that doesn't work well.
                
overweight and obesity-related health problems in children and teens
                
overweight and obesity also increase the health risks for children and teens. type2 diabetes once was rare in american children, but an increasing number of children are developing the disease.

what is (are) adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ?,"key points
                    - adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).    - leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.    - previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing all.    - signs and symptoms of adult all include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.     - tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult all.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
                    adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. this type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.
                
                
                    leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         a lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  b lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  t lymphocytes that help b lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         in all, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, b lymphocytes, or t lymphocytes. these cells are also called leukemia cells. these leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. this may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. the cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     this summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. see the following pdq summaries for information about other types of leukemia:          -  childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.    -  adult acute myeloid leukemia treatment.    -  childhood acute myeloid leukemia/other myeloid malignancies treatment.    -  chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment.    -  chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment.    -  hairy cell leukemia treatment."
what is the outlook for myasthenia gravis ?,"with treatment, most individuals with myasthenia can significantly improve their muscle weakness. some case of myasthenia gravis may go into remission temporarily, and muscle weakness may disappear so that medications can be discontinued. in a few cases, the severe weakness of myasthenia gravis may cause respiratory failure, which requires immediate emergency medical care."
what are the genetic changes related to adermatoglyphia ?,"adermatoglyphia is caused by mutations in the smarcad1 gene. this gene provides information for making two versions of the smarcad1 protein: a full-length version that is active (expressed) in multiple tissues and a shorter version that is expressed only in the skin. studies suggest that the full-length smarcad1 protein regulates the activity of a wide variety of genes involved in maintaining the stability of cells' genetic information. little is known about the function of the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein, but it appears to play a critical role in dermatoglyph formation. dermatoglyphs develop before birth and remain the same throughout life. the activity of this protein is likely one of several factors that determine each person's unique fingerprint pattern.  the smarcad1 gene mutations that cause adermatoglyphia affect only the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein. these mutations reduce the total amount of this protein available in skin cells. although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause adermatoglyphia, researchers speculate that a shortage of the skin-specific version of the smarcad1 protein impairs signaling pathways needed for normal skin development and function, including the formation of dermatoglyphs."
what are the treatments for dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"how might dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency be treated? there are currently no consensus recommendations for the management of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld) deficiency. management can be hard because various metabolic pathways are affected and 3 enzyme complexes are involved. deficiencies in enzyme pathways vary depending on the specific mutation(s) each affected person has. unfortunately, the treatments that have been attempted in children with the early-onset neurologic form do not appear to significantly alter the course of the disease. even with treatment, children often do not survive infancy or have varying degrees of chronic neurologic impairment if they survive the initial episode. depending on individual enzyme complex deficiencies, treatment may involve certain dietary restrictions or certain diets; use of medical foods; and/or supplementation of specific amino acids or other substances. there is limited data for the chronic management of people with the primarily hepatic (liver-related) form of the disease. management typically involves supportive therapy during times of acute liver injury or failure, and may include nutritional support; iv glucose for hypoglycemia; correction of metabolic acidosis; correction of coagulopathy; and avoidance of liver-toxic medications. more detailed information about the management of dld deficiency can be viewed on the genereviews web site. genereviews is intended for use by genetics professionals. those not familiar with the principles discussed on the genereviews web site are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional or other healthcare provider regarding information of interest."

how many people are affected by sjgren syndrome ?,"sjgren syndrome is a relatively common disorder; it occurs in 0.1 to 4 percent of the population. it is difficult to determine the exact prevalence because the characteristic features of this disorder, dry eyes and dry mouth, can also be caused by many other conditions. women develop sjgren syndrome about 10 times more often than men; the specific reason for this difference is unknown but likely involves the effects of sex hormones on immune system function."
what are the treatments for hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius ?,"how might hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius be treated? the treatment of hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius (hsas) is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. for example, hydrocephalus is typically treated with shunt surgery. special education and early intervention may be recommended for children with intellectual disability. although intervention is rarely necessary for adducted thumbs (bent towards the palms), tendon transfer surgery or splinting may be suggested in some cases."

what is the outlook for electrocardiogram ?,"an electrocardiogram (ekg) is painless and harmless. a nurse or technician will attach soft, sticky patches called electrodes to the skin of your chest, arms, and legs. the patches are about the size of a quarter.
                
often, 12 patches are attached to your body. this helps detect your heart's electrical activity from many areas at the same time. the nurse may have to shave areas of your skin to help the patches stick.
                
after the patches are placed on your skin, you'll lie still on a table while the patches detect your heart's electrical signals. a machine will record these signals on graph paper or display them on a screen.
                
the entire test will take about 10 minutes.

special types of electrocardiogram
                
the standard ekg described above, called a resting 12-lead ekg, only records seconds of heart activity at a time. it will show a heart problem only if the problem occurs during the test.
                
many heart problems are present all the time, and a resting 12-lead ekg will detect them. but some heart problems, like those related to an irregular heartbeat, can come and go. they may occur only for a few minutes a day or only while you exercise.
                
doctors use special ekgs, such as stress tests and holter and event monitors, to help diagnose these kinds of problems.
                
stress test
                
some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. during stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while an ekg is done. if you can't exercise, you'll be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.

holter and event monitors
                
holter and event monitors are small, portable devices. they record your heart's electrical activity while you do your normal daily activities. a holter monitor records your heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period.
                
an event monitor records your heart's electrical activity only at certain times while you're wearing it. for many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.
                
for more information, go to the health topics holter and event monitors article."
is small fiber neuropathy inherited ?,"small fiber neuropathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered scn9a gene or scn10a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  when the genetic cause of small fiber neuropathy is unknown or when the condition is caused by another disorder, the inheritance pattern is unclear."

what is (are) multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations ?,"multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations (also known as vmcm) are bluish patches (lesions) on the skin (cutaneous) and the mucous membranes, such as the lining of the mouth and nose. these lesions represent areas where the underlying veins and other blood vessels did not develop properly (venous malformations). the lesions can be painful, especially when they extend from the skin into the muscles and joints, or when a calcium deposit forms within the lesion causing inflammation and swelling.  most people with vmcm are born with at least one venous malformation. as affected individuals age, the lesions present from birth usually become larger and new lesions often appear. the size, number, and location of venous malformations vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family."
what are the treatments for linear porokeratosis ?,"how might linear porokeratosis be treated? because linear porokeratosis is a rare condition, there is no established treatment protocol.  protection from sun exposure and regular visits to a doctor to check for skin cancer are encouraged as routine care.  treatment options depend on the size, location, and severity of the characteristic skin markings.  several medications (5-fluorouracil, acitretin) have been shown to be effective for treating this condition in a small number of patients.  we identified a single report of photodynamic therapy being used to successfully treat an individual with linear porokeratosis.  surgery is recommended to remove any skin cancer that may develop."
what is (are) urinary incontinence in men ?,"the types of ui in men include
                
- urgency incontinence  - stress incontinence  - functional incontinence  - overflow incontinence  - transient incontinence
                
urgency incontinence
                
urgency incontinence happens when a man urinates involuntarily after he has a strong desire, or urgency, to urinate. involuntary bladder contractions are a common cause of urgency incontinence. abnormal nerve signals might cause these bladder contractions.
                
triggers for men with urgency incontinence include drinking a small amount of water, touching water, hearing running water, or being in a cold environmenteven if for just a short whilesuch as reaching into the freezer at the grocery store. anxiety or certain liquids, medications, or medical conditions can make urgency incontinence worse.
                
the following conditions can damage the spinal cord, brain, bladder nerves, or sphincter nerves, or can cause involuntary bladder contractions leading to urgency incontinence:
                
- alzheimers diseasea disorder that affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language  - injury to the brain or spinal cord that interrupts nerve signals to and from the bladder  - multiple sclerosisa disease that damages the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells, which slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the body  - parkinsons diseasea disease in which the cells that make a chemical that controls muscle movement are damaged or destroyed  - strokea condition in which a blocked or ruptured artery in the brain or neck cuts off blood flow to part of the brain and leads to weakness, paralysis, or problems with speech, vision, or brain function
                
urgency incontinence is a key sign of overactive bladder. overactive bladder occurs when abnormal nerves send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without enough warning time to get to the toilet. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, nerve disease and bladder control.
                
stress incontinence
                
stress incontinence results from movements that put pressure on the bladder and cause urine leakage, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or physical activity. in men, stress incontinence may also occur
                
- after prostate surgery  - after neurologic injury to the brain or spinal cord  - after trauma, such as injury to the urinary tract  - during older age
                
functional incontinence
                
functional incontinence occurs when physical disability, external obstacles, or problems in thinking or communicating keep a person from reaching a place to urinate in time. for example, a man with alzheimers disease may not plan ahead for a timely trip to a toilet. a man in a wheelchair may have difficulty getting to a toilet in time. arthritispain and swelling of the jointscan make it hard for a man to walk to the restroom quickly or open his pants in time.
                
overflow incontinence
                
when the bladder doesnt empty properly, urine spills over, causing overflow incontinence. weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence. nerve damage from diabetes or other diseases can lead to weak bladder muscles; tumors and urinary stones can block the urethra. men with overflow incontinence may have to urinate often, yet they release only small amounts of urine or constantly dribble urine.
                
transient incontinence
                
transient incontinence is ui that lasts a short time. transient incontinence is usually a side effect of certain medications, drugs, or temporary conditions, such as
                
- a urinary tract infection (uti), which can irritate the bladder and cause strong urges to urinate  - caffeine or alcohol consumption, which can cause rapid filling of the bladder  - chronic coughing, which can put pressure on the bladder  - constipationhard stool in the rectum can put pressure on the bladder  - blood pressure medications that can cause increased urine production  - short-term mental impairment that reduces a mans ability to care for himself  - short-term restricted mobility"
what is (are) north american indian childhood cirrhosis ?,"north american indian childhood cirrhosis is a rare liver disorder that occurs in children. the liver malfunction causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) in affected infants. the disorder worsens with age, progressively damaging the liver and leading to chronic, irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis) in childhood or adolescence. unless it is treated with liver transplantation, north american indian childhood cirrhosis typically causes life-threatening complications including liver failure."
what is (are) tyrosinemia type 1 ?,"tyrosinemia type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. this condition is caused by a shortage of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, one of the enzymes required for the multi-step process that breaks down tyrosine. this enzyme shortage is caused by mutations in the fah gene. symptoms usually appear in the first few months of life and include failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice, cabbage-like odor, and increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). tyrosinemia type i can lead to liver and kidney failure, problems affecting the nervous system, and an increased risk of liver cancer. this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

what are the genetic changes related to dihydropyrimidinase deficiency ?,"dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is caused by mutations in the dpys gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidinase. this enzyme is involved in the breakdown of molecules called pyrimidines, which are building blocks of dna and its chemical cousin rna. the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme is involved in the second step of the three-step process that breaks down pyrimidines. this step opens the ring-like structures of molecules called 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil so that these molecules can be further broken down.  the dpys gene mutations that cause dihydropyrimidinase deficiency greatly reduce or eliminate dihydropyrimidinase enzyme function. as a result, the enzyme is unable to begin the breakdown of 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil. excessive amounts of these molecules accumulate in the blood and in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or csf) and are released in the urine.  the relationship between the inability to break down 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil and the specific features of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is unclear. failure to complete this step in the breakdown of pyrimidines also impedes the final step of the process, which produces molecules called beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine. both of these molecules are thought to protect the nervous system and help it function properly. reduced production of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine may impair the function of these molecules in the nervous system, leading to neurological problems in some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency. because fluoropyrimidine drugs are broken down by the same three-step process as pyrimidines, deficiency of the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme could lead to the drug buildup that causes fluoropyrimidine toxicity.  it is unknown why some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency do not develop health problems related to the condition; other genetic and environmental factors likely help determine the effects of this disorder."
what is (are) hypopituitarism ?,"hypopituitarism occurs when the body has low levels of certain hormones made by the pituitary gland.  the pituitary gland normally makes several hormones (including growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, and oxytocin).  these hormones are important for directing body growth and development, and for regulating blood pressure and metabolism.  symptoms of this condition vary and depend on which hormones are affected.  treatment depends on the cause of this condition; once the cause is corrected, medication (hormone replacement therapy) must be taken to provide the body with the normal amount of hormones."
is periventricular heterotopia inherited ?,"periventricular heterotopia can have different inheritance patterns. when this condition is caused by mutations in the flna gene, it is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern.  a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  in x-linked periventricular heterotopia, males experience much more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, and in most cases die before birth.  in about 50 percent of cases of x-linked periventricular heterotopia, an affected person inherits the mutation from a mother who is also affected. other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  periventricular heterotopia caused by mutations in the arfgef2 gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. individuals with periventricular heterotopia in whom arfgef2 gene mutations have been identified have a severe form of the disorder, including microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and seizures beginning in infancy. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) spinocerebellar ataxia 11 ?,"spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (sca11) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia (difficulty walking and balance) and abnormal eye signs (jerky pursuit, horizontal and vertical movements (nystagmus), pyramidal features (increased muscular tonus, increased reflexes and an abnormal reflex known as babinski sign and inability to make to perform fine movements), peripheral neuropathy with numbness, weakness or pain in the feet or hands or other places of the body and dystonia. it is a very rare disease and very few patients have been reported to date. in them, age of onset ranged from the early teens to the second decade of life and life span was normal. diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms and with a genetic exam showing an alteration (mutation) in the ttbk2 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. treatment may include speech and language therapy for talking and swallowing problems, occupational therapy, including home adaptations, physiotherapy and use of assistive walking devices and ankle-foot orthotics (afos) for those with neuropathy."

what are the symptoms of human t-cell leukemia virus type 2 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of human t-cell leukemia virus, type 2? human t-cell leukemia virus, type 2 (htlv-2) generally causes no signs or symptoms. although htlv-2 has not been definitively linked with any specific health problems, scientists suspect that some affected people may later develop neurological problems such as:[7046] sensory neuropathies (conditions that affect the nerves that provide feeling) gait abnormalities bladder dysfunction mild cognitive impairment motor abnormalities (loss of or limited muscle control or movement, or limited mobility) erectile dysfunction although evidence is limited, there may also be a link between htlv-2 and chronic lung infections (i.e. pneumonia and bronchitis), arthritis, asthma, and dermatitis."
what is (are) adrenal gland disorders ?,"the adrenal glands are small glands located on top of each kidney. they produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and cortisol. cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important functions.    with adrenal gland disorders, your glands make too much or not enough hormones. in cushing's syndrome, there's too much cortisol, while with addison's disease, there is too little. some people are born unable to make enough cortisol.    causes of adrenal gland disorders include       - genetic mutations    - tumors including pheochromocytomas    - infections    - a problem in another gland, such as the pituitary, which helps to regulate the adrenal gland    - certain medicines      treatment depends on which problem you have. surgery or medicines can treat many adrenal gland disorders.    nih: national institute of child health and human development"
what are the genetic changes related to x-linked infantile spasm syndrome ?,"x-linked infantile spasm syndrome is caused by mutations in either the arx gene or the cdkl5 gene. the proteins produced from these genes play a role in the normal functioning of the brain. the arx protein is involved in the regulation of other genes that contribute to brain development. the cdkl5 protein is thought to regulate the activity of at least one protein that is critical for normal brain function. researchers are working to determine how mutations in either of these genes lead to seizures and intellectual disability.  infantile spasms can have nongenetic causes, such as brain malformations, other disorders that affect brain function, or brain damage. in addition, changes in genes that are not located on the x chromosome cause infantile spasms in rare cases."

what is the outlook for hairy cell leukemia ?,"certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). the treatment options may depend on the following:         - the number of hairy (leukemia) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow.    - whether the spleen is swollen.    - whether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia, such as infection.    - whether the leukemia has recurred (come back) after previous treatment.        the prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - whether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment.    - whether the hairy cell leukemia responds to treatment.        treatment often results in a long-lasting remission (a period during which some or all of the signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone). if the leukemia returns after it has been in remission, retreatment often causes another remission."
what is (are) shingles ?,"shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. after you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. it may not cause problems for many years. as you get older, the virus may reappear as shingles. although it is most common in people over age 50, anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.    you can't catch shingles from someone who has it. however, if you have a shingles rash, you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox. this would usually be a child, who could get chickenpox instead of shingles. the virus spreads through direct contact with the rash, and cannot spread through the air.    early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching, usually on one side of the body or face. the pain can be mild to severe. rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. if shingles appears on your face, it may affect your vision or hearing. the pain of shingles may last for weeks, months, or even years after the blisters have healed.     there is no cure for shingles. early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. these medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.    a vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects. the vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over. in some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.    nih: national institute of allergy and infectious diseases"
what is (are) sexual assault ?,"sexual assault is any sexual activity to which you haven't freely given your consent. this includes completed or attempted sex acts that are against your will. sometimes it can involve a victim who is unable to consent. it also includes abusive sexual contact. it can happen to men, women or children.    the attacker can be anyone - a current or former partner, a family member, a person in position of power or trust, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger.    sexual assault can affect your health in many ways. it can lead to long-term health and emotional problems. it is important to seek help if you have been assaulted. first, get to a safe place. then dial 9-1-1 or go to a hospital for medical care. you may want to have counseling to deal with your feelings. the most important thing to know is that the assault was not your fault.    centers for disease control and prevention"
is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?,"how is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited? osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of oi. the mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). when a person with an autosomal dominant form of oi has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene. if the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. less commonly, oi is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. the parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of oi have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."
what are the treatments for myhre syndrome ?,"how might myhre syndrome be treated? treatment of this condition is symptomatic and supportive. children with myhre syndrome may require management by a team of specialists, including pediatricians, speech pathologists, orthopedists (bone specialists), cardiologists (heart specialists), audiologists (hearing specialists), and physical therapists. early intervention is important to help ensure that children with myhre syndrome reach their full potential."
what causes lipedema ?,"what causes lipedema? the cause of lipedema is unknown. hormones appear to play a role, especially considering that the condition occurs almost entirely in females and often develops after puberty or other periods of hormone change (e.g., pregnancy, menopause). although people who are obese may be overrepresented among those with lipedema, persons of normal weight are also commonly affected. as a result, obesity alone is unlikely to be a major determinant of this syndrome. many people with lipedema have a family history of similarly enlarged legs. at this time the role of genetics in the causation of lipedema is unknown."
what is (are) primary sclerosing cholangitis ?,"primary sclerosing cholangitis is a condition that affects the bile ducts. these ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps to digest fats) from the liver, where bile is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small intestine, where it aids in digestion. primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs because of inflammation in the bile ducts (cholangitis) that leads to scarring (sclerosis) and narrowing of the ducts. as a result, bile cannot be released to the gallbladder and small intestine, and it builds up in the liver.  primary sclerosing cholangitis is usually diagnosed around age 40, and for unknown reasons, it affects men twice as often as women. many people have no signs or symptoms of the condition when they are diagnosed, but routine blood tests reveal liver problems. when apparent, the earliest signs and symptoms of primary sclerosing cholangitis include extreme tiredness (fatigue), discomfort in the abdomen, and severe itchiness (pruritus). as the condition worsens, affected individuals may develop yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). eventually, the buildup of bile damages the liver cells, causing chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) and liver failure. without bile available to digest them, fats pass through the body. as a result, weight loss and shortages of vitamins that are absorbed with and stored in fats (fat-soluble vitamins) can occur. a fat-soluble vitamin called vitamin d helps absorb calcium and helps bones harden, and lack of this vitamin can cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis.  primary sclerosing cholangitis is often associated with another condition called inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by inflammation of the intestines that causes open sores (ulcers) in the intestines and abdominal pain. however, the reason for this link is unclear. approximately 70 percent of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have inflammatory bowel disease, most commonly a form of the condition known as ulcerative colitis. in addition, people with primary sclerosing cholangitis are more likely to have an autoimmune disorder, such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or thyroid disease, than people without the condition. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma)."
what are the genetic changes related to leptin receptor deficiency ?,"leptin receptor deficiency is caused by mutations in the lepr gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called the leptin receptor, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. the leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. the hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. it also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body.  the leptin receptor is turned on (activated) by a hormone called leptin that attaches (binds) to the receptor, fitting into it like a key into a lock. normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. as fat cells become larger, they produce more leptin. this rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing. in the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).  lepr gene mutations that cause leptin receptor deficiency prevent the receptor from responding to leptin, leading to the excessive hunger and weight gain associated with this disorder. because hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs in leptin receptor deficiency, researchers suggest that leptin receptor signaling is also involved in regulating the body's response to hormones that control sexual development, and that this response is affected by lepr gene mutations. however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown.  leptin receptor deficiency is a rare cause of obesity. researchers are studying the factors involved in more common forms of obesity."

what are the genetic changes related to ren-related kidney disease ?,"mutations in the ren gene cause ren-related kidney disease. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called renin that is produced in the kidneys. renin plays an important role in regulating blood pressure and water levels in the body.  mutations in the ren gene that cause ren-related kidney disease result in the production of an abnormal protein that is toxic to the cells that normally produce renin. these kidney cells gradually die off, which causes progressive kidney disease."
what causes dry eye ?,"many factors can lead to dry eye, including aging, medications, problems with eyelid function, disease, some types of surgery, environmental factors, and allergies. many older people have dry eye elderly people often have dryness of the eyes, but dry eye can occur at any age. nearly five million americans 50 years of age and older are estimated to have dry eye. of these, more than three million are women and more than one and a half million are men. tens of millions more have less severe symptoms. dry eye is more common after menopause. women who experience menopause prematurely are more likely to have eye surface damage from dry eye.  medications dry eye can be a side effect of some medications, including antihistamines, nasal decongestants, tranquilizers, certain blood pressure medicines, parkinson's medications, and some anti-depressants. women who are on hormone replacement therapy may experience dry eye symptoms. eyelid function eyelid function can also be a factor in dry eye. diseases that affect the eyelid, such as meibomian gland dysfunction, can also cause dry eye. dry eye may also occur from exposure keratitis, in which the eyelids do not close properly during normal blinking or sleep. skin diseases on or around the eyelids can result in dry eye. infrequent blinking associated with staring at computer or video screens also may lead to dry eye symptoms. systemic diseases certain diseases can cause dry eye. chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva, or the lacrimal glands, can cause dry eye. immune system disorders such as sjgren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis also can cause dry eye. sjgren's syndrome leads to inflammation and dryness of the mouth, eyes, and other mucous membranes. thyroid disease, which can sometimes cause the eye to bulge out, can also lead to dry eye by increasing the surface area of the eye exposed to the environment. surgeries some types of surgery can lead to dry eye. for example, dry eye can develop after the refractive surgery known as lasik. these symptoms generally last three to six months, but may last longer in some cases. dry eye can also occur as a result of cosmetic surgery that widens the eyelids too much and increases the surface area of the eye exposed to the environment. environment environmental exposure to irritants such as chemical fumes and tobacco smoke, or drafts from air conditioning or heating can cause dry eye. wearing contact lenses over a long period of time can lead to a loss of feeling in the cornea and this can cause dry eye. allergies also can be associated with dry eye."
what is (are) isolated duane retraction syndrome ?,"isolated duane retraction syndrome is a disorder of eye movement. this condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). as the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. most commonly, only one eye is affected. about 10 percent of people with isolated duane retraction syndrome develop amblyopia (""lazy eye""), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye.  about 70 percent of all cases of duane retraction syndrome are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. duane retraction syndrome can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other areas of the body. for example, duane-radial ray syndrome is characterized by this eye disorder in conjunction with abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands.  researchers have identified three forms of isolated duane retraction syndrome, designated types i, ii, and iii. the types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). all three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward."
is ring chromosome 20 syndrome inherited ?,"ring chromosome 20 syndrome is almost never inherited. a ring chromosome typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. often, the ring chromosome is present in only some of a person's cells. this situation is known as mosaicism.  most affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families. however, at least one family has been reported in which a ring chromosome 20 was passed from a mother to her children."

how to diagnose human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 ?,"how is human t-cell leukemia virus, type 1 diagnosed? human t-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (htlv-1) is usually diagnosed based on blood tests that detect antibodies to the virus. however, htlv-1 is often never suspected or diagnosed since most people (95%) never develop any signs or symptoms of the infection. diagnosis may occur during screening for blood donation, testing performed due to a family history of the infection, or a work-up for an htlv-1-associated condition such as adult t-cell leukemia (atl) or htlv-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (ham/tsp)."
what are the genetic changes related to 5-alpha reductase deficiency ?,"mutations in the srd5a2 gene cause 5-alpha reductase deficiency. the srd5a2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called steroid 5-alpha reductase 2. this enzyme is involved in processing androgens, which are hormones that direct male sexual development. specifically, the enzyme is responsible for a chemical reaction that converts the hormone testosterone to dht. dht is essential for the normal development of male sex characteristics before birth, particularly the formation of the external genitalia.  mutations in the srd5a2 gene prevent steroid 5-alpha reductase 2 from effectively converting testosterone to dht in the developing reproductive tissues. these hormonal factors underlie the changes in sexual development seen in infants with 5-alpha reductase deficiency.  during puberty, the testes produce more testosterone. researchers believe that people with 5-alpha reductase deficiency develop secondary male sex characteristics in response to higher levels of this hormone. some affected people also retain a small amount of 5-alpha reductase 2 activity, which may produce dht and contribute to the development of secondary sex characteristics during puberty."
what are the genetic changes related to familial hemiplegic migraine ?,"mutations in the cacna1a, atp1a2, scn1a, and prrt2 genes have been found to cause familial hemiplegic migraine. the first three genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the transport of charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. the movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. the function of the protein produced from the prrt2 gene is unknown, although studies suggest it interacts with a protein that helps control signaling between neurons.  communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. researchers believe that mutations in the cacna1a, atp1a2, and scn1a genes can upset the balance of ions in neurons, which disrupts the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. although the mechanism is unknown, researchers speculate that mutations in the prrt2 gene, which reduce the amount of prrt2 protein, also disrupt normal control of neurotransmitter release. the resulting changes in signaling between neurons lead people with familial hemiplegic migraine to develop these severe headaches.  there is little evidence that mutations in the cacna1a, atp1a2, scn1a, and prrt2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as familial hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine."
is mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) gerd ?,"your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. this allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it.     you may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn. sometimes, you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth. if you have these symptoms more than twice a week, you may have gerd. you can also have gerd without having heartburn. your symptoms could include a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing.    anyone, including infants and children, can have gerd. if not treated, it can lead to more serious health problems. in some cases, you might need medicines or surgery. however, many people can improve their symptoms by       - avoiding alcohol and spicy, fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburn    - eating smaller meals    - not eating close to bedtime     - losing weight if needed     - wearing loose-fitting clothes       nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what is (are) multiple system atrophy ?,"multiple system atrophy (msa) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms of autonomic nervous system failure such as fainting spells and bladder control problems, combined with motor control symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and loss of muscle coordination. msa affects both men and women primarily in their 50s. although what causes msa is unknown, the disorder's symptoms reflect the loss of nerve cells in several different areas in the brain and spinal cord that control the autonomic nervous system and coordinate muscle movements. the loss of nerve cells may be due to the buildup of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the cells that support nerve cells in the brain."

what are the treatments for hypoaldosteronism ?,how might hypoaldosteronism be treated? treatment for hypoaldosteronism depends on the underlying condition. affected individuals are often advised to follow a low-potassium diet with liberal sodium intake. people with hypoaldosteronism should typically avoid ace inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics. individuals with hypoaldosteronism and a deficiency of adrenal glucocorticoid hormones are usually given fludrocortisone. people with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism are frequently given furosemide to correct hyperkalemia.
what to do for whipple disease ?,"- whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine. left untreated, whipple disease gets worse and is usually life threatening.  - bacteria called tropheryma whipplei (t. whipplei) cause whipple disease. t. whipplei infection can cause internal sores, also called lesions, and thickening of tissues in the small intestine.  - anyone can get whipple disease. however, it is more common in caucasian men between 40 and 60 years old.  - signs and symptoms of whipple disease can vary widely from person to person. the most common symptoms of whipple disease are      - diarrhea    - weight loss caused by malabsorption    - people with whipple disease may have complications caused by malnutrition, which is due to damaged villi in the small intestine.  - the health care provider prescribes antibiotics to destroy the t. whipplei bacteria and treat whipple disease.  - the health care provider usually prescribes intravenous (iv) antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two.  - after a patient completes the iv antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics.  - most patients have good outcomes with an early diagnosis and complete treatment."
how to diagnose primary lateral sclerosis ?,"how is primary lateral sclerosis diagnosed? there is no single test that confirms a diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis (pls). because the disease can mimic signs and symptoms of other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), several tests are done to rule out other diseases. after taking a careful record of an individual's medical history and performing a complete neurological examination, a doctor may order the following tests: blood work. blood tests are done to check for infections or other possible causes of muscle weakness. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain and spine. an mri or other imaging tests may reveal signs of nerve cell degeneration and look for other causes of symptoms, such as structural abnormalities, spinal cord compression, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord tumors. motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. these tests use a low amount of electrical current to test how quickly the nerves carry impulses through the body, and can indicate damage to nerve cells. electromyogram (emg). during this test, the doctor inserts a needle electrode through the skin into various muscles. the electrical activity of the muscles is evaluated when they contract and when they're at rest. this test can measure the involvement of lower motor neurons, which can help to differentiate between pls and als. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) analysis. an analysis of the csf, which is taken during a lumbar puncture in the lower back, can help to rule out multiple sclerosis and other causes of spasticity. after other diseases are ruled out, a doctor may make a preliminary diagnosis of pls. sometimes doctors wait three to four years before being sure of the diagnosis, because early als can look just like pls until additional symptoms surface a few years later."

what are the genetic changes related to 5q minus syndrome ?,"5q- syndrome is caused by deletion of a region of dna from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million dna building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (mb). however, the size of the deleted region varies. this deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one of the two copies of chromosome 5 in each cell.  the commonly deleted region of dna contains 40 genes, many of which play a critical role in normal blood cell development. research suggests that loss of multiple genes in this region contributes to the features of 5q- syndrome. loss of the rps14 gene leads to the problems with red blood cell development characteristic of 5q- syndrome, and loss of mir145 or mir146a contributes to the megakaryocyte and platelet abnormalities and may promote the overgrowth of immature cells. scientists are still determining how the loss of other genes in the deleted region might be involved in the features of 5q- syndrome."
how can botulism be prevented?,"many cases of botulism are preventable. foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. however, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. in alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the us department of agriculture. oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  the bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older."
"what is (are) diabetes, heart disease, and stroke ?","prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. prediabetes is also called impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. many people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. in addition, they are at risk for heart disease and stroke. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, people with prediabetes can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes and lower their risk of heart disease and stroke."
is type a insulin resistance syndrome inherited ?,"type a insulin resistance syndrome can have either an autosomal dominant or, less commonly, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  in autosomal dominant inheritance, one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  in autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

how to diagnose cardiomyopathy ?,"your doctor will diagnose cardiomyopathy based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.
                
specialists involved
                
often, a cardiologist or pediatric cardiologist diagnoses and treats cardiomyopathy. a cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases. a pediatric cardiologist is a cardiologist who treats children.
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor will want to learn about your medical history. he or she will want to know what signs and symptoms you have and how long you've had them.
                
your doctor also will want to know whether anyone in your family has had cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest.
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs for sounds that may suggest cardiomyopathy. these sounds may even suggest a certain type of the disease.
                
for example, the loudness, timing, and location of a heart murmur may suggest obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. a ""crackling"" sound in the lungs may be a sign of heart failure. (heart failure often develops in the later stages of cardiomyopathy.)
                
physical signs also help your doctor diagnose cardiomyopathy. swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, or veins in your neck suggests fluid buildup, a sign of heart failure.
                
your doctor may notice signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy during a routine exam. for example, he or she may hear a heart murmur, or you may have abnormal test results.
                
diagnostic tests
                
your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose cardiomyopathy.
                
blood tests
                
during a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. it's often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. the procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.
                
blood tests give your doctor information about your heart and help rule out other conditions.
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. this test can show whether your heart is enlarged. a chest x ray also can show whether fluid is building up in your lungs.
                
ekg (electrocardiogram)
                
an ekg is a simple test that records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.
                
this test is used to detect and study many heart problems, such as heart attacks, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart failure. ekg results also can suggest other disorders that affect heart function.
                
a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. it won't detect problems that don't happen during the test.
                
to diagnose heart problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable ekg monitor. the two most common types of portable ekgs are holter and event monitors.
                
holter and event monitors
                
holter and event monitors are small, portable devices. they record your heart's electrical activity while you do your normal daily activities. a holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period.
                
an event monitor records your heart's electrical activity only at certain times while you're wearing it. for many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. the picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape.
                
there are several types of echo, including stress echo. this test is done as part of a stress test (see below). stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease.
                
another type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-jee-ul) echo, or tee. tee provides a view of the back of the heart.
                
for this test, a sound wave wand is put on the end of a special tube. the tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). because this passage is right behind the heart, tee can create detailed pictures of the heart's structures.
                
before tee, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine.
                
stress test
                
some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. during stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.
                
these tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (pet) scanning of the heart.
                
diagnostic procedures
                
you may have one or more medical procedures to confirm a diagnosis or to prepare for surgery (if surgery is planned). these procedures may include cardiac catheterization (kath-e-ter-i-za-shun), coronary angiography (an-jee-og-ra-fee), or myocardial (mi-o-kar-de-al) biopsy.
                
cardiac catheterization
                
this procedure checks the pressure and blood flow in your heart's chambers. the procedure also allows your doctor to collect blood samples and look at your heart's arteries using x-ray imaging.
                
during cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. this allows your doctor to study the inside of your arteries for blockages.
                
coronary angiography
                
this procedure often is done with cardiac catheterization. during the procedure, dye that can be seen on an x ray is injected into your coronary arteries. the dye lets your doctor study blood flow through your heart and blood vessels.
                
dye also may be injected into your heart chambers. this allows your doctor to study the pumping function of your heart.
                
myocardial biopsy
                
for this procedure, your doctor removes a piece of your heart muscle. this can be done during cardiac catheterization. the heart muscle is studied under a microscope to see whether changes in cells have occurred. these changes may suggest cardiomyopathy.
                
myocardial biopsy is useful for diagnosing some types of cardiomyopathy.
                
genetic testing
                
some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. thus, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to look for the disease in your parents, brothers and sisters, or other family members.
                
genetic testing can show how the disease runs in families. it also can find out the chances of parents passing the genes for the disease on to their children.
                
genetic testing also may be useful if your doctor thinks you have cardiomyopathy, but you don't yet have signs or symptoms. if the test shows you have the disease, your doctor can start treatment early, when it may work best."

what is (are) degenerative nerve diseases ?,"degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. many of these diseases are genetic. sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism, a tumor, or a stroke. other causes may include toxins, chemicals, and viruses. sometimes the cause is not known.    degenerative nerve diseases include       -  alzheimer's disease    -  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis    - friedreich's ataxia    -  huntington's disease    -  lewy body disease    - parkinson's disease     -  spinal muscular atrophy       degenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. it depends on the type. most of them have no cure. treatments may help improve symptoms, relieve pain, and increase mobility."
is oral-facial-digital syndrome inherited ?,"oral-facial-digital syndrome type i is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. some cells produce a normal amount of ofd1 protein and other cells produce none. the resulting overall reduction in the amount of this protein leads to the signs and symptoms of oral-facial-digital syndrome type i.  in males (who have only one x chromosome), mutations result in a total loss of the ofd1 protein. a lack of this protein is usually lethal very early in development, so very few males are born with oral-facial-digital syndrome type i. affected males usually die before birth, although a few have lived into early infancy.  most of the other forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which suggests that both copies of a causative gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
do you have information about antibiotics,"summary : antibiotics are powerful medicines that fight bacterial infections. used properly, antibiotics can save lives. they either kill bacteria or keep them from reproducing. your body's natural defenses can usually take it from there.     antibiotics do not fight infections caused by viruses, such as       - colds     - flu     - most coughs and bronchitis     - sore throats, unless caused by strep        if a virus is making you sick, taking antibiotics may do more harm than good. using antibiotics when you don't need them, or not using them properly, can add to antibiotic resistance. this happens when bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic.    when you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. it is important to finish your medicine even if you feel better. if you stop treatment too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you. do not save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription.     centers for disease control and prevention"
what are the treatments for spondylothoracic dysostosis ?,"what treatment is available for spondylothoracic dysostosis? many infants born with spondylothoracic dysostosis have difficulty breathing due to their small, malformed chests, and therefore are prone to repeated respiratory infections (pneumonia). as the infant grows, the chest is too small to accommodate the growing lungs, and as a result, life threatening complications may develop. treatment usually consists of intensive medical care, including treatment of respiratory infections, bone surgery, and orthopedic treatment."
what is (are) juvenile-onset dystonia ?,"juvenile-onset dystonia is a form of dystonia, which is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause repetitive movements and/or abnormal postures. the severity and frequency of the movements vary significantly; in some affected people, they may be barely noticeable while in others, the movements are severely disabling and painful. dystonia can affect just one muscle, a group of muscles or all muscles of the body. other signs and symptoms of the condition may include a tremor or other neurologic features. in juvenile-onset dystonia, specifically, affected people develop features of the condition between the ages of 13 and 20 years. the underlying cause of juvenile-onset dystonia is poorly understood in most cases. changes (mutations) in the actb gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner have been identified in some families with the condition. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications, surgery, physical therapy, and other treatments to reduce or eliminate muscle spasms and pain."
what is (are) prescription and illicit drug abuse ?,"physical dependence is a normal process that can happen to anyone taking a medication for a long time. it means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. they may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. however, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse. an addicted person compulsively seeks and abuses drugs, despite their negative consequences."

how many people are affected by cystic fibrosis ?,"cystic fibrosis is a common genetic disease within the white population in the united states. the disease occurs in 1 in 2,500 to 3,500 white newborns. cystic fibrosis is less common in other ethnic groups, affecting about 1 in 17,000 african americans and 1 in 31,000 asian americans."
what is (are) nonsyndromic paraganglioma ?,"paraganglioma is a type of noncancerous (benign) tumor that occurs in structures called paraganglia. paraganglia are groups of cells that are found near nerve cell bunches called ganglia. paragangliomas are usually found in the head, neck, or torso. however, a type of paraganglioma known as pheochromocytoma develops in the adrenal glands. adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney and produce hormones in response to stress. most people with paraganglioma develop only one tumor in their lifetime.  some people develop a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma as part of a hereditary syndrome that may affect other organs and tissues in the body. however, the tumors often are not associated with any syndromes, in which case the condition is called nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma.  pheochromocytomas and some other paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic nervous system controls the ""fight-or-flight"" response, a series of changes in the body due to hormones released in response to stress. although most sympathetic paragangliomas are pheochromocytomas, some are found outside the adrenal glands, usually in the abdomen, and are called extra-adrenal paragangliomas. most sympathetic paragangliomas, including pheochromocytomas, produce hormones called catecholamines, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine. these excess catecholamines can cause signs and symptoms such as high blood pressure (hypertension), episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations), headaches, or sweating.  most paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as digestion and saliva formation. parasympathetic paragangliomas, typically found in the head and neck, usually do not produce hormones. however, large tumors may cause signs and symptoms such as coughing, hearing loss in one ear, or difficulty swallowing.  although most paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are noncancerous, some can become cancerous (malignant) and spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). extra-adrenal paragangliomas become malignant more often than other types of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma."

do you have information about biodefense and bioterrorism,"summary : a bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs to cause illness or death. these germs are often found in nature. but they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease, spread, or resist medical treatment.    biological agents spread through the air, water, or in food. some can also spread from person to person. they can be very hard to detect. they don't cause illness for several hours or days. scientists worry that anthrax, botulism, ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague, or smallpox could be used as biological agents.    biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. this includes medicines and vaccinations. it also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.    centers for disease control and prevention"
what are the symptoms of x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 1 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 1? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 1. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) cellular immunodeficiency 90% decreased antibody level in blood 50% hepatomegaly 50% lymphadenopathy 50% lymphoma 50% splenomegaly 50% anemia 7.5% encephalitis - fulminant hepatitis - hepatic encephalopathy - igg deficiency - immunodeficiency - increased igm level - meningitis - pancytopenia - recurrent pharyngitis - reduced natural killer cell activity - thrombocytopenia - x-linked recessive inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) early-onset primary dystonia ?,"early-onset primary dystonia is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement, typically beginning in childhood. dystonia is a movement disorder that involves involuntary tensing of the muscles (muscle contractions), twisting of specific body parts such as an arm or a leg, rhythmic shaking (tremors), and other uncontrolled movements. a primary dystonia is one that occurs without other neurological symptoms, such as seizures or a loss of intellectual function (dementia). early-onset primary dystonia does not affect a person's intelligence.  on average, the signs and symptoms of early-onset primary dystonia appear around age 12. abnormal muscle spasms in an arm or a leg are usually the first sign. these unusual movements initially occur while a person is doing a specific action, such as writing or walking. in some affected people, dystonia later spreads to other parts of the body and may occur at rest. the abnormal movements persist throughout life, but they do not usually cause pain.  the signs and symptoms of early-onset primary dystonia vary from person to person, even among affected members of the same family. the mildest cases affect only a single part of the body, causing isolated problems such as a writer's cramp in the hand. severe cases involve abnormal movements affecting many regions of the body."

people who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath.
                
bronchitis
                

                
overview
                
the two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing).
                
acute bronchitis
                
infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. the same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. these viruses are spread through the air when people cough. they also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed).
                
sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis.
                
acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. however, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone.
                
several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis.
                
most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. if you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. he or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care.
                
chronic bronchitis
                
chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. it occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.
                
viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. if this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. as a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual.
                
chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. the chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis."

what is (are) am i at risk for type 2 diabetes? taking steps to lower your risk of getting diabetes ?,"in addition to type 2, the other main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.
                
type 1 diabetes
                
type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. in this type of diabetes, your pancreas can no longer make insulin because your bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed the cells that make it. treatment for type 1 diabetes includes taking insulin shots or using an insulin pump, making wise food choices, being physically active on a regular basis, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and, for some, taking aspirin daily.
                
gestational diabetes
                
gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. hormones produced by your placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. if your pancreas cant produce enough insulin, gestational diabetes occurs.
                
as with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. gestational diabetes occurs more often in some ethnic groups and among women with a family history of diabetes.
                
although gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes as they grow up."
what causes froelich syndrome ?,"what causes froelich syndrome? froehlich syndrome is usually caused by lesions in the hypothalamic gland or pituitary gland. the lesions may be caused by a tumor (e.g., craniopharyngioma), swelling from an infection (e.g., tuberculosis), encephalitis, or other brain injuries."
what causes fibromuscular dysplasia ?,"what causes fibromuscular dysplasia? the cause of fibromuscular dysplasia is unknown. it is likely that there are many factors that contribute to the development of this condition. these factors may include blood vessel abnormalities, tobacco use, hormone levels, and genetic predispositions. approximately 28 percent of affected individuals have more than one artery with fibromuscular dysplasia. it is not known why some people develop this condition in more than one artery."
"what is (are) tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines ?","tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough) are serious bacterial infections. tetanus causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. it can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw. diphtheria usually affects the nose and throat. whooping cough causes uncontrollable coughing. vaccines can protect you from these diseases. in the u.s., there are four combination vaccines:       - dtap prevents all three diseases. it is for children younger than seven years old.    - tdap also prevents all three. it is for older children and adults.    - dt prevents diphtheria and tetanus. it is for children younger than seven who cannot tolerate the pertussis vaccine.    - td prevents diphtheria and tetanus. it is for older children and adults. it is usually given as a booster dose every 10 years. you may also get it earlier if you get a severe and dirty wound or burn.       some people should not get these vaccines, including those who have had severe reactions to the shots before. check with your doctor first if you have seizures, a neurologic problem, or guillain-barre syndrome. also let your doctor know if you don't feel well the day of the shot; you may need to postpone it.    centers for disease control and prevention"
what is the outlook for iniencephaly ?,the prognosis for infants with iniencephaly is extremely poor. newborns seldom survive much past childbirth. the distortions of the babys body also pose a danger to the mother's life during delivery.
what are the symptoms of trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome? while the symptoms of trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome vary from patient to patient, characteristic symptoms include the inability to open the mouth wide (e.g., less than 6 mm, just under 1/4 of an inch) and shortened muscles, including of the hamstrings and calf muscles. as a result of shortened muscles some infants with trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome have closed or clinched fists, club foot, metatarsus adductus, and calcaneovalgus (where the foot bends sharply at the ankle) at birth. children with this syndrome may crawl on their knuckles. in adulthood the syndrome may cause reduced hand dexterity, however hand limitation does not often interfere with normal function. the most serious complications of the condition occur as a result of the limited mobility of the mouth, including impairment of adequate calorie intake, speech development, dental care, and difficulty with intubation. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the musculature 90% limitation of joint mobility 90% short stature 90% symphalangism affecting the phalanges of the hand 90% abnormality of the hip bone 7.5% mandibular prognathia 7.5% ptosis 7.5% deep philtrum 5% macrocephaly 5% autosomal dominant inheritance - cutaneous syndactyly of toes - distal arthrogryposis - dysphagia - facial asymmetry - feeding difficulties - hammertoe - hip dislocation - talipes equinovarus - trismus - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what are the symptoms of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids? hdls is characterized by leukoencephalopathy, which is damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter (made up of nerve fibers (axons) covered by myelin). also common in hdls are swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. this damage is thought to contribute to the symptoms see in this condition, including personality changes (including a loss of social inhibitions and depression which are among the earliest symptoms of hdls), memory loss and loss of executive function (the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies which impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention appropriately). some people with hdls have mild seizures early in the disease and may experience a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia) as the disease progresses. over time, motor skills are affected, and people with hdls may have difficulty walking. many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary trembling (tremor), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). the pattern of cognitive and motor problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family. over time, almost all affected individuals become unable to walk, speak, and care for themselves. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) adult onset - apraxia - autosomal dominant inheritance - bradykinesia - cns demyelination - depression - frontal lobe dementia - gliosis - hyperreflexia - leukoencephalopathy - memory impairment - mutism - neuronal loss in central nervous system - postural instability - rapidly progressive - rigidity - shuffling gait - spasticity - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for primary biliary cirrhosis ?,"treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis depends on how early a health care provider diagnoses the disease and whether complications are present. in the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment can slow the progression of liver damage to cirrhosis. in the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications. as cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications.
                
medications
                
health care providers prescribe ursodiol (actigall, urso) to treat primary biliary cirrhosis. ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are more toxic and can harm the liver. treatment with ursodiol can reduce levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in the blood. early treatment with this medication reduces the likelihood of needing a liver transplant and improves survival.3 early treatment provides the most benefit; however, ursodiol treatment late in the course of the disease can still slow the progression of liver damage. while ursodiol treatment improves the outcome of primary biliary cirrhosis, it does not cure the disease.
                
researchers are studying the effects of several other medications on the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. to date, none has shown the positive effects of ursodiol.
                
avoiding alcohol and other substances
                
people with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage. people with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs. people with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. many vitamins and prescription and over-the-counter medications can affect liver function.
                
treatment of symptoms and complications
                
health care providers treat symptoms and complications as follows:
                
itching. antihistamines may help with mild itching. however, antihistamines often cause drowsiness, and a person should take antihistamines just before bedtime to help with nighttime itching. a health care provider will treat more problematic itching with cholestyramine (locholest, questran), which reduces cholesterol in the blood. experts believe high levels of cholesterol let substances that cause itching build up in tissues.
                
dry eyes and mouth. health care providers usually treat dry eyes and mouth with artificial tears and saliva substitutes, respectively. these products are available without a prescription. a health care provider may treat people whose symptoms do not improve with pilocarpine (salagen) or cevimeline (evoxac). people who have difficulty with dry eyes should see an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersregularly. people with dry mouth should have regular dental exams.
                
portal hypertension. a health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.
                
varices. beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. this procedure involves using an endoscope to look for varices. the health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. a gastroenterologist performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. people who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.
                
edema and ascites. health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. a health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. a health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. he or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (iv) antibiotics.
                
hepatic encephalopathy. a health care provider will treat hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. a health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.
                
osteoporosis. a health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.
                
gallstones and bile duct stones. a health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. he or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve the bile duct stones.
                
liver cancer. a health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer. screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease. cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early. health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. he or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy."
is mucopolysaccharidosis type vi inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) retinitis pigmentosa ?,"retinitis pigmentosa is a group of related eye disorders that cause progressive vision loss. these disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. in people with retinitis pigmentosa, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate.  the first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which becomes apparent in childhood. problems with night vision can make it difficult to navigate in low light. later, the disease causes blind spots to develop in the side (peripheral) vision. over time, these blind spots merge to produce tunnel vision. the disease progresses over years or decades to affect central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. in adulthood, many people with retinitis pigmentosa become legally blind.  the signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are most often limited to vision loss. when the disorder occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic. researchers have identified several major types of nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked.  less commonly, retinitis pigmentosa occurs as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. these forms of the disease are described as syndromic. the most common form of syndromic retinitis pigmentosa is usher syndrome, which is characterized by the combination of vision loss and hearing loss beginning early in life. retinitis pigmentosa is also a feature of several other genetic syndromes, including bardet-biedl syndrome; refsum disease; and neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (narp)."
what is (are) achromatopsia ?,"achromatopsia is a condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision. people with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination.  achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). these vision problems develop in the first few months of life.  achromatopsia is different from the more common forms of color vision deficiency (also called color blindness), in which people can perceive color but have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, such as red and green."
what are the genetic changes related to 2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"mutations in the acadsb gene cause 2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency.  the acadsb gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase that helps process the amino acid isoleucine. mutations in the acadsb gene reduce or eliminate the activity of this enzyme. with a shortage (deficiency) of 2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase, the body is unable to break down isoleucine properly. as a result, isoleucine is not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of this disorder, such as lethargy and muscle weakness. also, an organic acid called 2-methylbutyrylglycine and related compounds may build up to harmful levels, causing serious health problems."
what are the symptoms of acth-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of acth-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for acth-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) hypercortisolism 90% round face 90% thin skin 90% truncal obesity 90% abnormality of the menstrual cycle 50% behavioral abnormality 50% bruising susceptibility 50% diabetes mellitus 50% hypertension 50% hypertrichosis 50% muscle weakness 50% nephrolithiasis 50% reduced bone mineral density 50% meningioma 7.5% adult onset - agitation - anxiety - autosomal dominant inheritance - decreased circulating acth level - depression - increased circulating cortisol level - kyphosis - macronodular adrenal hyperplasia - mental deterioration - mood changes - neoplasm - osteopenia - osteoporosis - primary hypercorticolism - psychosis - skeletal muscle atrophy - sporadic - striae distensae - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
how many people are affected by congenital leptin deficiency ?,congenital leptin deficiency is a rare disorder. only a few dozen cases have been reported in the medical literature.
what causes urachal cyst ?,"what causes a urachal cyst? a urachal cyst occurs when a pocket of air or fluid develops in the urachus. before birth, the urachus is a primitive structure that connects the umbilical cord to the bladder in the developing baby. the urachus normally disappears before birth, but part of the urachus may remain in some people after they are born. this can lead to urachal abnormalities such as urachal cysts."
what is (are) kbg syndrome ?,"kbg syndrome is a rare condition characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability. specific signs and symptoms may include delayed bone age; abnormalities of the bones of the spine, ribs, and/or hands; large teeth (macrodontia); short stature; developmental delay; and behavioral or emotional issues. less common features may include hearing loss, seizures, and congenital heart defects. in some cases, kbg syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ankrd11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. in other cases, the genetic cause is unclear. some affected people inherit the condition from a parent, while in other people it occurs sporadically."
what is (are) schwartz jampel syndrome type 1 ?,"schwartz jampel syndrome type 1 (sjs1) is a genetic disorder that affects bone and muscle development. signs and symptoms may include muscle weakness and stiffness, abnormal bone development, joint contractures,  short stature, small, fixed facial features, and eye abnormalities (some of which may impair vision). sjs1 can be divided into two subtypes differentiated by severity and age of onset. type 1a, considered classic sjs, is the most commonly recognized type. individuals with type 1a typically develop more mild symptoms later in childhood, while individuals with type 1b have symptoms that are more severe and are apparent immediately after birth. sjs1 is caused by mutations in the hspg2 gene which makes a protein called perlecan. sjs1 is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, some cases reported in the medical literature suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. treatment for both type 1a and 1b aims to normalize muscle activity through various methods including massage and stretching, medications such as botulinum toxin, and surgery.  there is a more severe, distinct condition called stuve-wiedemann syndrome which is caused by mutations in the lifr gene. at one time cases of stuve-wiedemann syndrome were referred to as neonatal schwartz jampel syndrome type 2. click on the link above to learn more about this syndrome."
what are the treatments for leukemia ?,"researchers are studying various drugs, immunotherapies, and other types of treatments. because leukemia is a complicated disease, researchers are also studying the effectiveness of using combinations of treatments. following are a few examples of some areas of current research. the drug imatinib (gleevec) is important in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. however, imatinib stops working in some people with leukemia because the cells become resistant. fortunately, two drugs, dasatinib (sprycel) and nilotinib (tasigna), are being used to treat people who stop responding to imatinib. both are approved by the fda for use in patients. these drugs work against the same abnormal protein targeted by imatinib, but in different ways. gene therapy -- replacing, manipulating, or supplementing nonfunctional genes with healthy genes -- is being explored for treatment of leukemia. it is being studied as a way to stimulate a patient's immune system to kill leukemia cells and also to interfere with the production of proteins that cause cells to become cancerous.  learn more about ongoing leukemia research."
what causes hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer ?,"what causes hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer? hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (hlrcc) is caused by changes (mutations) in the fh gene. this gene gives the body instructions for making an enzyme called fumarase which is needed for a series of reactions that lets cells use oxygen and energy (the citric acid cycle, or krebs cycle). people with hlrcc are born with one mutated copy of the fh gene in each cell. the second copy of the gene in some cells can mutate later on from factors in the environment, such as radiation from the sun or an error during cell division. a mutation can interfere with fumarase's role in the citric acid cycle, which may affect the regulation of oxygen levels in cells. long-term oxygen deficiency in cells with two mutated copies of the fh gene may contribute to tumors growth and the tendency to develop leiomyomas and/or renal cell cancer."
what are the symptoms of viral gastroenteritis ?,"the main symptoms of viral gastroenteritis are
                
- watery diarrhea  - vomiting

how to diagnose congenital heart defects ?,"severe congenital heart defects generally are diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth. less severe defects often aren't diagnosed until children are older.
                
minor defects often have no signs or symptoms. doctors may diagnose them based on results from a physical exam and tests done for another reason.
                
specialists involved
                
pediatric cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the care of babies and children who have heart problems. cardiac surgeons are specialists who repair heart defects using surgery.
                
physical exam
                
during a physical exam, the doctor will:
                
listen to your child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope
                
look for signs of a heart defect, such as cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, delayed growth, or signs of heart failure
                
diagnostic tests
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. during the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. a computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.
                
echo allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.
                
echo is an important test for both diagnosing a heart problem and following the problem over time. the test can show problems with the heart's structure and how the heart is reacting to those problems. echo will help your child's cardiologist decide if and when treatment is needed.
                
during pregnancy, if your doctor suspects that your baby has a congenital heart defect, fetal echo can be done. this test uses sound waves to create a picture of the baby's heart while the baby is still in the womb.
                
fetal echo usually is done at about 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. if your child is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect before birth, your doctor can plan treatment before the baby is born.

an ekg is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.
                
an ekg can detect if one of the heart's chambers is enlarged, which can help diagnose a heart problem.
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. this test can show whether the heart is enlarged. it also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.
                
pulse oximetry
                
for this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). the sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood.
                
cardiac catheterization
                
during cardiac catheterization (kath-e-ter-ih-za-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. the tube is threaded to the heart.
                
special dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the hearts chambers. the dye allows the doctor to see blood flowing through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.
                
the doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. this can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart.
                
cardiac catheterization also is used to repair some heart defects."
is ataxia neuropathy spectrum inherited ?,"ataxia neuropathy spectrum can have different inheritance patterns depending on the associated gene.  mutations in the polg gene cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  mutations in the c10orf2 gene cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
what is (are) noonan syndrome 3 ?,"noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of multiple parts of the body. features of noonan syndrome may include a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, a broad or webbed neck, congenital heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and developmental delay. noonan syndrome may be caused by mutations in any one of several genes including the ptpn11, kras, raf1, sos1, nras and braf genes. it is sometimes referred to as a specific subtype based on the responsible gene in an affected person. noonan syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but many cases are due to a new mutation and are not inherited from an affected parent."
what is (are) legius syndrome ?,"legius syndrome is a condition characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation). almost all affected individuals have multiple caf-au-lait spots, which are flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area. another pigmentation change, freckles in the armpits and groin, may occur in some affected individuals.  other signs and symptoms of legius syndrome may include an abnormally large head (macrocephaly) and unusual facial characteristics. although most people with legius syndrome have normal intelligence, some affected individuals have been diagnosed with learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder (add), or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd).  many of the signs and symptoms of legius syndrome also occur in a similar disorder called neurofibromatosis type 1. it can be difficult to tell the two disorders apart in early childhood. however, the features of the two disorders differ later in life."
what are the treatments for transverse myelitis ?,"no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis. physicians often prescribe corticosteroid therapy during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. following initial therapy, the most critical part of the treatment for this disorder consists of keeping the patients body functioning while hoping for either complete or partial spontaneous recovery of the nervous system. if an individual begins to recover limb control, physical therapy begins to help improve muscle strength, coordination, and range of motion."

what is (are) spastic paraplegia type 4 ?,"spastic paraplegia type 4 is part of a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias. these disorders are characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity) and the development of paralysis of the lower limbs (paraplegia). hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types: pure and complex. the pure types involve only the lower limbs, whereas the complex types also involve the upper limbs (to a lesser degree) and the nervous system. spastic paraplegia type 4 is a pure hereditary spastic paraplegia.  like all hereditary spastic paraplegias, spastic paraplegia type 4 involves spasticity of the leg muscles and muscle weakness. people with this condition can also experience exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), ankle spasms, high-arched feet (pes cavus), and reduced bladder control. spastic paraplegia type 4 generally affects nerve and muscle function in the lower half of the body only."
what is (are) benign essential blepharospasm ?,"benign essential blepharospasm is a condition characterized by abnormal blinking or spasms of the eyelids. this condition is a type of dystonia, which is a group of movement disorders involving uncontrolled tensing of the muscles (muscle contractions), rhythmic shaking (tremors), and other involuntary movements. benign essential blepharospasm is different from the common, temporary eyelid twitching that can be caused by fatigue, stress, or caffeine.  the signs and symptoms of benign essential blepharospasm usually appear in mid- to late adulthood and gradually worsen. the first symptoms of the condition include an increased frequency of blinking, dry eyes, and eye irritation that is aggravated by wind, air pollution, sunlight, and other irritants. these symptoms may begin in one eye, but they ultimately affect both eyes. as the condition progresses, spasms of the muscles surrounding the eyes cause involuntary winking or squinting. affected individuals have increasing difficulty keeping their eyes open, which can lead to severe vision impairment.  in more than half of all people with benign essential blepharospasm, the symptoms of dystonia spread beyond the eyes to affect other facial muscles and muscles in other areas of the body. when people with benign essential blepharospasm also experience involuntary muscle spasms affecting the tongue and jaw (oromandibular dystonia), the combination of signs and symptoms is known as meige syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to imerslund-grsbeck syndrome ?,"mutations in the amn or cubn gene can cause imerslund-grsbeck syndrome. the amn gene provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless, and the cubn gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin. together, these proteins play a role in the uptake of vitamin b12 from food. vitamin b12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of dna and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. this vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).  the amnionless protein is embedded primarily in the membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. amnionless attaches (binds) to cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. during digestion, vitamin b12 is released from food. as the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin b12 complex into the intestinal cell. from there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. in the kidney, the amnionless and cubilin proteins are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.  mutations in the amn gene prevent cubilin from attaching to the cells in the small intestine and kidneys. without cubilin function in the small intestine, vitamin b12 is not taken into the body. a shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. low levels of vitamin b12 can also affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems. in addition, without cubilin function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed and are instead released in urine, leading to proteinuria.  like amn gene mutations, some cubn gene mutations impair cubilin's function in both the small intestine and the kidneys, leading to a shortage of vitamin b12 and proteinuria. other cubn gene mutations affect cubilin's function only in the small intestine, impairing uptake of vitamin b12 into the intestinal cells. individuals with these mutations have a shortage of vitamin b12, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neurological problems, but not proteinuria."
what is (are) deafness and myopia syndrome ?,"deafness and myopia syndrome is rare condition that affects both hearing and vision. beginning at birth or in early infancy, people with this condition have moderate to profound hearing loss in both ears that generally becomes worse over time. affected people also develop severe myopia (nearsightedness) later in infancy or early childhood. deafness and myopia syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the slitrk6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment aims to improve hearing loss and correct myopia. cochlear implantation may be an option for some affected people."
what is (are) guillain-barr syndrome ?,"guillain-barr syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. the first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. in many instances, the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. these symptoms can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be used at all and the person is almost totally paralyzed. in these cases, the disorder is life-threatening and is considered a medical emergency. the individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing. most individuals, however, have good recovery from even the most severe cases of guillain-barr syndrome (gbs), although some continue to have some degree of weakness. guillain-barr syndrome is rare. usually guillain-barr occurs a few days or weeks after the person has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. occasionally, surgery will trigger the syndrome. in rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of gbs. the disorder can develop over the course of hours or days, or it may take up to 3 to 4 weeks. no one yet knows why guillain-barr strikes some people and not others or what sets the disease in motion. what scientists do know is that the body's immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease. guillain-barr is called a syndrome rather than a disease because it is not clear that a specific disease-causing agent is involved. reflexes such as knee jerks are usually lost. because the signals traveling along the nerve are slower, a nerve conduction velocity (ncv) test can give a doctor clues to aid the diagnosis. the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain contains more protein than usual, so a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap."
what is (are) diabetes in children and teens ?,"until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. it was called juvenile diabetes. with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.    but now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. but now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.    children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are obese, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active, and do not eat well. to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children       - have them maintain a healthy weight    - be sure they are physically active    - have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods    - limit time with the tv, computer, and video       children and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. type 2 diabetes may be controlled with diet and exercise. if not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin. a blood test called the a1c can check on how you are managing your diabetes."
what are the symptoms of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) epileptic encephalopathy - muscular hypotonia of the trunk - status epilepticus - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what to do for intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"- intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage, or obstruction, of the intestines, also called the bowel. however, when a health care provider examines the intestines, no blockage exists. instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.  - intestinal pseudo-obstruction symptoms may include abdominal swelling or bloating, also called distension; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; constipation; and diarrhea. over time, the condition can cause malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, and weight loss.  - to diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. a health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. a health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis.  - a health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. rarely, a person will need surgery. if an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both. a health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed."

how to diagnose antisynthetase syndrome ?,"how is antisynthetase syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms once other conditions that cause similar features have been ruled out. additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis, determine the severity of the condition, and inform treatment. this testing varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person, but may include: blood tests to evaluate levels of muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase and aldolase laboratory tests to look for the presence of autoantibodies associated with antisynthetase syndrome high resolution computed tomography (hrct) of the lungs electromyography (emg) muscle biopsy pulmonary function testing magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of affected muscles evaluation of swallowing difficulties and aspiration risk lung biopsy"
what is (are) chromosome 3p- syndrome ?,"chromosome 3p- syndrome is a rare chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located towards the end of the short arm (p) of chromosome 3. the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the exact size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. some affected people appear to have no features or mild features, while others are more severely affected. common symptoms shared by many people with this deletion include poor growth, developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, autism spectrum disorder, an unusually small head (microcephaly), and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."
what is (are) crohn's disease ?,"the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusa 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body. the body digests food using the movement of muscles in the gi tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes. organs that make up the gi tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestinewhich includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectumand anus. the last part of the gi tractcalled the lower gi tractconsists of the large intestine and anus. the intestines are sometimes called the bowel."
what causes chiari malformation type 1 ?,"what causes chiari malformation type 1? primary or congenital chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord that occur during fetal development. the underlying cause of the structural defects are not completely understood, but may involve genetic mutations or lack of proper vitamins or nutrients in the maternal diet. less frequently, chiari malformation type 1 is acquired after birth. causes of acquired chiari malformation type 1 involve the excessive draining of spinal fluid from the lumbar or thoracic areas of the spine as a result of injury, exposure to harmful substances, or infection. click here to view a diagram of the spine."
what is (are) traumatic brain injury ?,"traumatic brain injury (tbi) happens when a bump, blow, jolt, or other head injury causes damage to the brain. every year, millions of people in the u.s. suffer brain injuries. more than half are bad enough that people must go to the hospital. the worst injuries can lead to permanent brain damage or death. half of all tbis are from motor vehicle accidents. military personnel in combat zones are also at risk.    symptoms of a tbi may not appear until days or weeks following the injury. a concussion is the mildest type. it can cause a headache or neck pain, nausea, ringing in the ears, dizziness, and tiredness. people with a moderate or severe tbi may have those, plus other symptoms:       - a headache that gets worse or does not go away    - repeated vomiting or nausea    - convulsions or seizures    - inability to awaken from sleep    - slurred speech    - weakness or numbness in the arms and legs    - dilated eye pupils       health care professionals use a neurological exam and imaging tests to assess tbi. serious traumatic brain injuries need emergency treatment. treatment and outcome depend on how severe the injury is. tbi can cause a wide range of changes affecting thinking, sensation, language, or emotions. tbi can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. people with severe injuries usually need rehabilitation.     nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke"
"is 48,xxyy syndrome inherited ?","this condition is not inherited; it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). an error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. in 48,xxyy syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes (one x and two y chromosomes). if that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one x chromosome, the resulting child will have two x chromosomes and two y chromosomes in each of the body's cells.  in a small percentage of cases, 48,xxyy syndrome results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes in a 46,xy embryo very soon after fertilization has occurred. this means that an normal sperm cell with one y chromosome fertilized a normal egg cell with one x chromosome, but right after fertilization nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes caused the embryo to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a 48,xxyy embryo."
what are the symptoms of problems with smell ?,"people who experience smell disorders either have a decrease in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors. total smell loss is relatively rare, but a decrease in the sense of smell occurs more often, especially in older adults. there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected. - some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced.  - other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia.   - sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul.   - still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia.   - smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia.  some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced. other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia. sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia. smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia."
who is at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation? ?,"disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) is the result of an underlying disease or condition. people who have one or more of the following conditions are most likely to develop dic:
                
sepsis (an infection in the bloodstream)

people who are bitten by poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), or those who have frostbite or burns, also are at risk for dic."
what causes thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis ?,"primary thrombocythemia
                
in this condition, faulty stem cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. what causes this to happen usually isn't known. when this process occurs without other blood cell disorders, it's called essential thrombocythemia.
                
a rare form of thrombocythemia is inherited. (""inherited"" means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes.) in some cases, a genetic mutation may cause the condition.
                
in addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets, the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia. they may form blood clots or, surprisingly, cause bleeding when they don't work well.
                
bleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von willebrand disease. this condition affects the blood clotting process.
                
after many years, scarring of the bone marrow can occur.
                
secondary thrombocytosis
                
this condition occurs if another disease, condition, or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise. for example, 35 percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, and lymphoma. sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer.
                
other conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are:
                
iron-deficiency anemia (uh-nee-me-uh)
                
hemolytic (hee-moh-lit-ick) anemia
                
absence of a spleen (after surgery to remove the organ)
                
inflammatory or infectious diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis
                
reactions to medicine
                
some conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time. examples of such conditions include:
                
recovery from serious blood loss
                
recovery from a very low platelet count caused by excessive alcohol use and lack of vitamin b12 or folate
                
acute (short-term) infection or inflammation
                
response to physical activity
                
although the platelet count is high in secondary thrombocytosis, the platelets are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia). thus, people who have secondary thrombocytosis have a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding."

what causes whipple disease ?,"bacteria called tropheryma whipplei (t. whipplei) cause whipple disease. t. whipplei infection can cause internal sores, also called lesions, and thickening of tissues in the small intestine. the villi take on an abnormal, clublike appearance and the damaged intestinal lining does not properly absorb nutrients, causing diarrhea and malnutrition. diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. over time, the infection spreads to other parts of the persons body and will damage other organs."
what are the treatments for congenital chloride diarrhea ?,"how might congenital chloride diarrhea be treated? there is no cure for the underlying condition, so treatment mainly focuses on the symptoms. studies have shown that early diagnosis and aggressive salt replacement therapy (replacing sodium and chloride, the 2 things that make up salt) are associated with normal growth and development, in addition to reduced mortality rates. in individuals with this condition, the goal is for the oral intake of chloride, sodium, and potassium to be greater than the amount lost through the feces (i.e., there must be a positive gastrointestinal balance) so that losses in sweat can be replaced. replacement therapy with nacl (sodium chloride) and kcl (potassium chloride) has been shown to be effective in children. one study showed that a medication called omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, reduces electrolyte losses in individuals and thus promotes a positive gastrointestinal balance. however, this treatment does not reduce the need for careful monitoring of dietary intake, electrolyte concentrations, and urinary chloride loss. another study discussed how butyrate could be effective in treating the condition, and that it is easily administered, useful in preventing severe dehydration episodes, and may be a promising approach for a long-term treatment."
is thalassemia inherited ?,"how is thalassemia inherited? in general, thalassemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, the inheritance can be quite complex as multiple genes can influence the production of hemoglobin. most people affected by beta thalassemia have mutations in both copies of the hbb gene in each cell. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition; although some carriers of beta thalassemia develop mild anemia. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. the inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complicated by the fact that mutations in two different genes (hba1 and hba2) are associated with the condition. people have two copies of the hba1 gene and two copies of the hba2 gene in each cell. for each gene, one copy is inherited from the mother and one is inherited from the father. if each parent is missing at least one gene copy, their children are at risk for having alpha thalassemia. however, the exact risk and the severity of each child's condition depends on how many gene copies are lost (deleted) and which combination of the hba1 and hba2 genes are affected."

what is (are) cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome ?,"cardiofaciocutaneous (cfc) syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), face (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous). people with this condition also have developmental delay and intellectual disability, usually ranging from moderate to severe. the signs and symptoms of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome overlap significantly with those of two other genetic conditions, costello syndrome and noonan syndrome. the three syndromes are part of a group of related conditions called the rasopathies and  they are distinguished by their genetic cause and specific patterns of signs and symptoms; however, it can be difficult to tell these conditions apart in infancy. the cfc syndroeme is caused by mutations in the braf (75%-80% of the cases), map2k1,  map2k2 or kras gene (in fewer than 5% of the cases). cfc syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition, however, most cases have resulted from new gene mutations and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. treatment is symptomatic and may include surgery to correct the heart problems."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"mutations in the cyp11b1 gene cause cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. the cyp11b1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. this enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. corticosterone gets converted to the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.  cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme. when 11-beta-hydroxylase is lacking, precursors that are used to form cortisol and corticosterone build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. the excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development, particularly in females with cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. a buildup in the precursors used to form corticosterone increases salt retention, leading to hypertension in individuals with the classic form of cah due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.  the amount of functional 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme that an individual produces typically determines the extent of abnormal sexual development. individuals with the classic form of the condition usually have cyp11b1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with low levels of function or no function at all. individuals with the non-classic form of the condition typically have cyp11b1 gene mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme with moderately reduced function. the severity of the signs and symptoms of sexual development do not appear to be related to the severity of the hypertension."

what are the genetic changes related to familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa ?,"as its name suggests, familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa is caused by mutations in the cebpa gene that are passed down within families. these inherited mutations are present throughout a person's life in virtually every cell in the body.  the cebpa gene provides instructions for making a protein called ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha. this protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and helps control the activity of certain genes. it is believed to act as a tumor suppressor, helping to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.  cebpa gene mutations that cause familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa result in a shorter version of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha. this shorter version is produced from one copy of the cebpa gene in each cell, and it is believed to interfere with the tumor suppressor function of the normal protein produced from the second copy of the gene. absence of the tumor suppressor function of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha is believed to disrupt the regulation of blood cell production in the bone marrow, leading to the uncontrolled production of abnormal cells that occurs in acute myeloid leukemia.  in addition to the inherited mutation in one copy of the cebpa gene in each cell, most individuals with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa also acquire a mutation in the second copy of the cebpa gene. the additional mutation, which is called a somatic mutation, is found only in the leukemia cells and is not inherited. the somatic cebpa gene mutations identified in leukemia cells generally decrease the dna-binding ability of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha. the effect of this second mutation on the development of acute myeloid leukemia is unclear."

what are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis? the peak age of onset is between ages 20 and 40, although it may develop in children and has also been identified in individuals over 60 years of age. the most common signs and symptoms include sensory disturbance of the limbs; partial or complete visual loss; acute and subacute motor dysfunction of the limbs; diplopia (double vision); and gait dysfunction. these signs and symptoms may occur alone or in combination, and have to be present for a minimum of 24 hours to be considered a ""clinical attack."" the signs and symptoms in individuals with ms are extremely variable, even among affected relatives within families. symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. episodes can last for days, weeks, or months. these episodes alternate with periods of reduced or no symptoms (remissions). while it is common for the disease to return (relapse), the disease may continue to get worse without periods of remission. because nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged, patients with multiple sclerosis can have symptoms in many parts of the body. muscle symptoms may include loss of balance, muscle spasms, numbness or abnormal sensation in any area, problems moving arms or legs, problems walking, problems with coordination and making small movements, and tremor or weakness in one or more arms or legs. bowel and bladder symptoms may include constipation and stool leakage, difficulty beginning to urinate, frequent need or strong urge to urinate, and incontinence. eye symptoms may include double vision, eye discomfort, uncontrollable rapid eye movements, and vision loss. there may be numbness, tingling, or pain in the face, muscles, arms or legs. other brain and nerve symptoms may include decreased attention span, poor judgment, and memory loss; difficulty reasoning and solving problems; depression or feelings of sadness; dizziness and balance problems; and hearing loss. individuals may also have slurred or difficult-to-understand speech, trouble chewing and swallowing, and sexual symptoms such as problems with erections or vaginal lubrication. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for multiple sclerosis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) cns demyelination - depression - diplopia - emotional lability - incoordination - multifactorial inheritance - muscle weakness - paresthesia - spasticity - urinary hesitancy - urinary incontinence - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for isobutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"how is isobutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency (ibd deficiency) treated? there is no standard treatment protocol for ibd deficiency. infants diagnosed through newborn screening are encouraged to work with a metabolic disease specialist and a dietician experienced in metabolic disorders. some treatments may be recommended even if no symptoms have been observed. treatment may be needed throughout life. the following treatments may be recommended for some babies and children with ibd deficiency.  children with ibd deficiency may be helped by taking l-carnitine, a safe and natural substance which helps the body's cells make energy and get rid of harmful wastes. l-carnitine may also help to prevent or treat the heart problems and anemia seen in children with ibd deficiency. children with ibd deficiency are advised to avoid fasting. going without food for a long time causes the body to use its stores of fat and protein for energy. in some people with ibd deficiency, this may lead to the build up of harmful substances in the blood. eating frequently (every 4 to 6 hours) may help to avoid these health effects. while most children with ibd deficiency do fine without a change in diet, a low-valine food plan might be necessary. valine is found in all foods with protein. foods high in valine, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans and legumes, nuts and peanut butter should be limited. there are medical foods such low-protein flours, pastas, rice, and special formulas that are made especially for people with organic acid disorders. your dietician / physician can advise you on whether you should use these foods to supplement your childs diet."
what are the genetic changes related to gilbert syndrome ?,"changes in the ugt1a1 gene cause gilbert syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-ugt) enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body.  the bilirubin-ugt enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. during this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body.  gilbert syndrome occurs worldwide, but some mutations occur more often in particular populations. in many populations, the most common genetic change that causes gilbert syndrome (known as ugt1a1*28) occurs in an area near the ugt1a1 gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of the bilirubin-ugt enzyme. this genetic change impairs enzyme production. however, this change is uncommon in asian populations, and affected asians often have a mutation that changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the bilirubin-ugt enzyme. this type of mutation, known as a missense mutation, results in reduced enzyme function.  people with gilbert syndrome have approximately 30 percent of normal bilirubin-ugt enzyme function. as a result, unconjugated bilirubin is not glucuronidated quickly enough. this toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing mild hyperbilirubinemia.  not everyone with the genetic changes that cause gilbert syndrome develops hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that additional factors, such as conditions that further hinder the glucuronidation process, may be necessary for development of the condition. for example, red blood cells may break down too easily, releasing excess amounts of bilirubin that the impaired enzyme cannot keep up with. alternatively, movement of bilirubin into the liver, where it would be glucuronidated, may be impaired. these other factors may be due to changes in other genes."

what is (are) hay fever ?,"each spring, summer, and fall, trees, weeds, and grasses release tiny pollen grains into the air. some of the pollen ends up in your nose and throat. this can trigger a type of allergy called hay fever.    symptoms can include       - sneezing, often with a runny or clogged nose    - coughing and postnasal drip    - itching eyes, nose and throat    - red and watery eyes    - dark circles under the eyes       your health care provider may diagnose hay fever based on a physical exam and your symptoms. sometimes skin or blood tests are used. taking medicines and using nasal sprays can relieve symptoms. you can also rinse out your nose, but be sure to use distilled or sterilized water with saline. allergy shots can help make you less sensitive to pollen and provide long-term relief.    nih: national institute of allergy and infectious diseases"
what are the treatments for acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis ?,"how might acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis be treated?  left untreated, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis not associated with a more serious condition may disappear on its own within one to three months. medications can improve skin lesions and associated symptoms in just two or three days, with the worst of the lesions disappearing within one to four weeks. doctors usually prescribe systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) to treat this condition. these oral anti-inflammatory medications reduce redness, itching, swelling and allergic reactions.  in the pediatric population, long-term use of corticosteroids can cause problems with linear growth, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. children may also have social sequelae associated with their use. therefore, attempts are usually made to treat children with steroid-sparing drugs. other treatment options include indomethacin, colchicine, potassium iodide, dapsone, cyclosporine, etretinate, pentoxifylline, clofazimine, doxycycline, metronidazole, isotretinoin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and interferon alpha, all of which have shown some success in the resolution of symtpoms.   with or without treatment, the lesions rarely leave a mark or scar when they eventually disappear. even after the lesions have resolved, treatment may continue, as recurrence of the condition is common. if an underlying cause can be identified, it should be treated (i.e. resection of solid tumors, treatment of infections, and discontinuation of causative medication). successful therapy of the underlying disorder may promote resolution of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and prevent recurrences."
what is (are) alagille syndrome ?,"alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.  one of the major features of alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. these ducts carry bile (which helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. in alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number (bile duct paucity). as a result, bile builds up in the liver and causes scarring that prevents the liver from working properly to eliminate wastes from the bloodstream. signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in alagille syndrome may include a yellowish tinge in the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas).  alagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis). pulmonic stenosis may occur along with a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect) and other heart abnormalities. this combination of heart defects is called tetralogy of fallot.  people with alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features including a broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin. the disorder may also affect the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the kidneys. affected individuals may have an unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) that can be seen in an x-ray.  problems associated with alagille syndrome generally become evident in infancy or early childhood. the severity of the disorder varies among affected individuals, even within the same family. symptoms range from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe heart and/or liver disease requiring transplantation.  some people with alagille syndrome may have isolated signs of the disorder, such as a heart defect like tetralogy of fallot, or a characteristic facial appearance. these individuals do not have liver disease or other features typical of the disorder."
what is (are) prickle1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia ?,"prickle1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia is a rare inherited condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and problems with movement. the signs and symptoms of this disorder usually begin between the ages of 5 and 10.  problems with balance and coordination (ataxia) are usually the first symptoms of prickle1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia. affected children often have trouble walking. their gait is unbalanced and wide-based, and they may fall frequently. later, children with this condition develop episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus), which cause additional problems with movement. myoclonus can also affect muscles in the face, leading to difficulty swallowing and slurred speech (dysarthria).  beginning later in childhood, some affected individuals develop tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures. these seizures involve a loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and convulsions. they often occur at night (nocturnally) while the person is sleeping.  prickle1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia does not seem to affect intellectual ability. although a few affected individuals have died in childhood, many have lived into adulthood."
is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?,"dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. depending on the severity of these mutations, people with two mutated copies of the dpyd gene in each cell may exhibit the signs and symptoms of this disorder, or they may be generally asymptomatic but at risk for toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs.  the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. however, people with one mutated copy of the dpyd gene in each cell may still experience toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs."
what is (are) breathing problems ?,"when you're short of breath, it's hard or uncomfortable for you to take in the oxygen your body needs. you may feel as if you're not getting enough air. sometimes mild breathing problems are from a stuffy nose or hard exercise. but shortness of breath can also be a sign of a serious disease.    many conditions can make you feel short of breath. lung conditions such as asthma, emphysema or pneumonia cause breathing difficulties. so can problems with your trachea or bronchi, which are part of your airway system. heart disease can make you feel breathless if your heart cannot pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. stress caused by anxiety can also make it hard for you to breathe. if you often have trouble breathing, it is important to find out the cause."
what are the symptoms of familial multiple trichodiscomas ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of familial multiple trichodiscomas? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for familial multiple trichodiscomas. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the hair - autosomal dominant inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) endocrine diseases ?,"your endocrine system includes eight major glands throughout your body. these glands make hormones. hormones are chemical messengers. they travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs. hormones work slowly and affect body processes from head to toe. these include       - growth and development    - metabolism - digestion, elimination, breathing, blood circulation and maintaining body temperature     - sexual function    - reproduction    - mood       if your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have a hormone disorder. hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to. stress, infection and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels.    in the united states, the most common endocrine disease is diabetes. there are many others. they are usually treated by controlling how much hormone your body makes. hormone supplements can help if the problem is too little of a hormone."

how to prevent broken heart syndrome ?,"researchers are still learning about broken heart syndrome, and no treatments have been shown to prevent it. for people who have experienced the condition, the risk of recurrence is low.
                
an emotionally upsetting or serious physical event can trigger broken heart syndrome. learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.
                
having supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. physical activity, medicine, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. you may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.
                
also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. learning to manage stress includes adopting healthy habits that will keep your stress levels low and make it easier to deal with stress when it does happen. a healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy diet, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for huntington's disease ?,"the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system, and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. a major focus of research on hd is to understand the toxicity of mutant huntingin protein to brain cells and to develop potential drugs for counteracting it. animal models of the disorder allow scientists to study mechanisms of the disease and to move forward with strategies most likely to work and least likely to cause harm for individuals. the hd gene discovery is allowing scientists to recruit individuals who carry the hd gene into clinical studies early  before they become ill. researchers hope to understand how the defective gene affects various structures in the brain and the body's chemistry and metabolism. since some of the clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by the ultimate malfunctioning of neuronal circuits rather than by the loss of individual cells, scientists are using cutting-edge methods such as optogenetics (where neurons are activated or silenced in the brains of living animals using light beams) to probe the cause and progression of such circuit defects in hd. scientists are also using stem cells to study disease mechanisms and test potential therapeutic drugs.
                
the ninds-funded predict-hd study seeks to identify biomarkers (biological changes that can be used to predict, diagnose, or monitor a disease) for hd. one goal of predict-hd is to determine if the progression of the disease correlates with changes in brain scans images, or with chemical changes in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. a large and related ninds-supported study aims to identify additional genetic factors in people that influence the course of the disease. since individuals with the same cag expansions can differ widely in the age of disease onset and severity of symptoms, researchers are trying to identify variations in the genomes of individuals with hd that account for those differences in the hopes that they will point to new targets for disease intervention and therapy."
how many people are affected by primary hyperoxaluria ?,"primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to affect 1 in 58,000 individuals worldwide. type 1 is the most common form, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. types 2 and 3 each account for about 10 percent of cases."
what is (are) limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis ?,"limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is a subtype of systemic sclerosis characterized by the association of raynaud's phenomenon and skin fibrosis on the hands, face, feet and forearms. the exact cause of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is unknown, but likely originates from an autoimmune reaction which leads to overproduction of collagen. in some cases, the condition is associated with exposure to certain chemicals. management is aimed at treating the symptoms present in each affected individual."
is bardet-biedl syndrome inherited ?,"bardet-biedl syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a bbs gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the treatments for primary myelofibrosis ?,"treatment of primary myelofibrosis in patients without signs or symptoms is usually watchful waiting.    patients with primary myelofibrosis may have signs or symptoms of anemia. anemia is usually treated with transfusion of red blood cells to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. in addition, anemia may be treated with:             -  erythropoietic growth factors.     -  prednisone.     -  danazol.     -  thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide, with or without prednisone.            treatment of primary myelofibrosis in patients with other signs or symptoms may include the following:            -  targeted therapy with ruxolitinib.     -  chemotherapy.     -  donor stem cell transplant.     - thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide.     -  splenectomy.     -  radiation therapy to the spleen, lymph nodes, or other areas outside the bone marrow where blood cells are forming.     -  biologic therapy using interferon alfa or erythropoietic growth factors.     - a clinical trial of other targeted therapy drugs.            check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with primary myelofibrosis. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website."
how to diagnose bronchitis ?,"your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. he or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough.
                
your doctor also will likely ask:
                
about your medical history
                
whether you've recently had a cold or the flu

whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution
                
your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. he or she also may:
                
look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection
                
test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe
                
recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests"
what are the treatments for iniencephaly ?,"there is no standard treatment for iniencephaly since most infants rarely live longer than a few hours. medicine is based more on prevention using supplementation with folic acid. numerous studies have demonstrated that mothers can reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects such as iniencephaly by up to 70 percent with daily supplements of at least 4 mg of folic acid. pregnant women should avoid taking antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, antihistamines, and sulfa drugs, which have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. maternal obesity and diabetes are also known to increase the risk for these disorders."
what is (are) uterine sarcoma ?,"key points
                    - uterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the muscles of the uterus or other tissues that support the uterus.    - being exposed to x-rays can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma.     - signs of uterine sarcoma include abnormal bleeding.     - tests that examine the uterus are used to detect (find) and diagnose uterine sarcoma.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    uterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the muscles of the uterus or other tissues that support the uterus.
                    the uterus is part of the female reproductive system. the uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped organ in the pelvis, where a fetus grows. the cervix is at the lower, narrow end of the uterus, and leads to the vagina.       uterine sarcoma is a very rare kind of cancer that forms in the uterine muscles or in tissues that support the uterus. (information about other types of sarcomas can be found in the pdq summary on adult soft tissue sarcoma treatment.) uterine sarcoma is different from cancer of the endometrium, a disease in which cancer cells start growing inside the lining of the uterus. (see the pdq summary on endometrial cancer treatment for information)."
who is at risk for extragonadal germ cell tumors? ?,age and gender can affect the risk of extragonadal germ cell tumors. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors include the following:         - being male.    - being age 20 or older.    - having klinefelter syndrome.

how to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia ?,"taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. these steps include:
                
seeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy
                
following a healthy diet
                
not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs
                
controlling any ongoing medical conditions you have
                
preventing infection
                
if your doctor thinks that you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.
                
the medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. it helps keep them open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.
                
usually, within about 24 hours of your taking this medicine, the baby's lungs start making enough surfactant. this will reduce the infant's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (rds), which can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd).
                
corticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.
                
if your baby does develop rds, it will probably be fairly mild. if the rds isn't mild, bpd will likely develop."
what is (are) kawasaki disease ?,"kawasaki (kah-wah-sah-ke) disease is a rare childhood disease. it's a form of a condition calledvasculitis(vas-kyu-li-tis). this condition involves inflammation of the blood vessels.
                
in kawasaki disease, the walls of the blood vessels throughout the body become inflamed. the disease can affect any type of blood vessel in the body, including the arteries, veins, and capillaries.
                
sometimes kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart. as a result, some children who have kawasaki disease may develop serious heart problems.
                
overview
                
the cause of kawasaki disease isn't known. the body's response to a virus or infection combined with genetic factors may cause the disease. however, no specific virus or infection has been found, and the role of genetics isn't known.
                
the disease can't be passed from one child to another. your child won't get it from close contact with a child who has the disease. also, if your child has the disease, he or she can't pass it to another child.
                
kawasaki disease affects children of all races and ages and both genders. it occurs most often in children of asian and pacific island descent. the disease is more likely to affect boys than girls. most cases occur in children younger than 5years old.
                
one of the main symptoms of kawasaki disease is a fever that lasts longer than5days. the fever remains high even after treatment with standard childhood fever medicines.
                
children who have the disease also may have red eyes, red lips, and redness on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. these are all signs of inflamed blood vessels.
                
early treatment helps reduce the risk of kawasaki disease affecting the coronary arteries and causing serious problems.
                
outlook
                
kawasaki disease can't be prevented. however, most children who have the disease usually recover within weeks of getting symptoms. further problems are rare.
                
the disease affects some children's coronary arteries, which can cause serious problems. these children need long-term care and treatment.
                
researchers continue to look for the cause of kawasaki disease and better ways to diagnose and treat it. they also hope to learn more about long-term health risks, if any, for people who have had the disease."
what are the treatments for microscopic colitis: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis ?,"treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. the gastroenterologist will
                
- review the medications the person is taking  - make recommendations to change or stop certain medications  - recommend that the person quit smoking
                
the gastroenterologist may prescribe medications to help control symptoms. medications are almost always effective in treating microscopic colitis. the gastroenterologist may recommend eating, diet, and nutrition changes. in rare cases, the gastroenterologist may recommend surgery.
                
medications
                
the gastroenterologist may prescribe one or more of the following:
                
- antidiarrheal medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (kaopectate, pepto-bismol), diphenoxylate/atropine (lomotil), and loperamide  - corticosteroids such as budesonide (entocort) and prednisone  - anti-inflammatory medications such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine (azulfidine)  - cholestyramine resin (locholest, questran)a medication that blocks bile acids  - antibiotics such as metronidazole (flagyl) and erythromycin  - immunomodulators such as mercaptopurine (purinethol), azathioprine (azasan, imuran), and methotrexate (rheumatrex, trexall)  - anti-tnf therapies such as infliximab (remicade) and adalimumab (humira)
                
corticosteroids are medications that decrease inflammation and reduce the activity of the immune system. these medications can have many side effects. scientists have shown that budesonide is safer, with fewer side effects, than prednisone. most health care providers consider budesonide the best medication for treating microscopic colitis.
                
patients with microscopic colitis generally achieve relief through treatment with medications, although relapses can occur. some patients may need long-term treatment if they continue to have relapses."
what is (are) malabsorption syndromes ?,"your small intestine does most of the digesting of the foods you eat. if you have a malabsorption syndrome, your small intestine cannot absorb nutrients from foods.    causes of malabsorption syndromes include       - celiac disease    - lactose intolerance    - short bowel syndrome. this happens after surgery to remove half or more of the small intestine. you might need the surgery if you have a problem with the small intestine from a disease, injury, or birth defect.    - whipple disease, a rare bacterial infection    - genetic diseases    - certain medicines       symptoms of different malabsorption syndromes can vary. they often include chronic diarrhea, abnormal stools, weight loss, and gas. your doctor may use lab, imaging, or other tests to make a diagnosis.    treatment of malabsorption syndromes depends on the cause."
is tourette syndrome inherited ?,"is tourette syndrome inherited? evidence from twin and family studies suggests that tourette syndrome is an inherited disorder. although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder), more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex. although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of tourette syndrome. genetic studies also suggest that some forms of adhd and ocd are genetically related to tourette syndrome, but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between tourette syndrome and other neurobehavioral problems that commonly co-occur with tourette syndrome. due to the complex nature of tourette syndrome inheritance, affected families and those at risk may benefit from consulting with a genetics professional. information about how to locate a genetics professional is provided in the living with section."
what is (are) klippel-trenaunay syndrome (kts) ?,"klippel-trenaunay syndrome (kts) is a rare congenital malformation involving blood and lymph vessels and abnormal growth of soft and bone tissue. typical symptoms include hemangiomas (abnormal benign growths on the skin consisting of masses of blood vessels) and varicose veins. fused toes or fingers, or extra toes or fingers, may be present. in some cases, internal bleeding may occur as a result of blood vessel malformations involving organs such as the stomach, rectum, vagina, liver, spleen, bladder, kidneys, lungs, or heart. individuals are also at risk for blood clots. the cause of the disorder is unknown. a similar port-wine stain disorder in which individuals have vascular anomalies on the face as well as in the brain is sturge-weber syndrome. these individuals may experience seizures and mental deficiency. in some cases, features of the klippel-trenaunay syndrome and sturge-weber syndrome coincide. another overlapping condition is the parkes-weber syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal connectivity between the arterial and venous system (arteriovenous fistulas)."
what are the symptoms of kidney disease ?,"kidney disease kidney disease is often called a ""silent"" disease, because most people have no symptoms with early kidney disease. in fact, you might feel just fine until your kidneys have almost stopped working. do not wait for symptoms! if you are at risk for kidney disease, talk to your health care provider about getting tested. (watch the video to learn more about the symptoms of kidney disease. to enlarge the videos on this page, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. to reduce the videos, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) symptoms of kidney failure kidney failure means that damaged kidneys are filtering less than 15% of the amount of blood filtered by healthy kidneys. if kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, a number of symptoms may occur. some people experience fatigue, some lose their appetite, and some have leg cramps. these problems are caused by waste products that build up in the blood, a condition known as uremia. healthy kidneys remove waste products from the blood. when the kidneys stop working, uremia occurs. the kidneys also make hormones and balance the minerals in the blood. when the kidneys stop working, most people develop conditions that affect the blood, bones, nerves, and skin. these problems may include itching, sleep problems, restless legs, weak bones, joint problems, and depression. how kidney disease is diagnosed  blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. it is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors, which are - diabetes  - high blood pressure   - heart disease  - a family history of kidney failure.  diabetes high blood pressure heart disease a family history of kidney failure. if you are at risk, ask about your kidneys at your next medical appointment. the sooner you know you have kidney disease, the sooner you can get treatment to help delay or prevent kidney failure. if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should get a blood and urine test to check your kidneys. talk to your provider about how often you should be tested. (watch the video to learn more about tests for kidney disease.) blood test the blood test checks your gfr. gfr stands for glomerular (glow-mair-you-lure) filtration rate. gfr is a measure of how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. this shows how well your kidneys are working. gfr is reported as a number. -  a gfr of 60 or higher is in the normal range.   - a gfr below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. however, because gfr decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease.  - a gfr of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure.  a gfr of 60 or higher is in the normal range. a gfr below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. however, because gfr decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease. a gfr of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure. you can't raise your gfr, but you can try to keep it from going lower. ask your healthcare provider what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy.  learn more about the gfr test. urine test the urine test looks for albumin (al-byoo-min), a type of protein, in your urine. a healthy kidney does not let albumin pass into the urine. a damaged kidney lets some albumin pass into the urine. this test has several different names. you could be told that you are being screened for ""proteinuria"" or ""albuminuria"" or ""microalbuminuria."" or you could be told that your ""urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio"" (uacr) is being measured. if you have albumin or protein in your urine, it could mean you have kidney disease. -  a urine albumin result below 30 is normal.  - a urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. a urine albumin result below 30 is normal. a urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. learn more about the urine albumin test. your healthcare provider might do additional tests to be sure."
what are the genetic changes related to sialuria ?,"mutations in the gne gene cause sialuria. the gne gene provides instructions for making an enzyme found in cells and tissues throughout the body. this enzyme is involved in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid, which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. by modifying these molecules, sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement (migration), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), signaling between cells, and inflammation.  the enzyme produced from the gne gene is carefully controlled to ensure that cells produce an appropriate amount of sialic acid. a feedback system shuts off the enzyme when no more sialic acid is needed. the mutations responsible for sialuria disrupt this feedback mechanism, resulting in an overproduction of sialic acid. this simple sugar builds up within cells and is excreted in urine. researchers are working to determine how an accumulation of sialic acid in the body interferes with normal development in people with sialuria."
is congenital fiber-type disproportion inherited ?,"congenital fiber-type disproportion can have multiple inheritance patterns.  when this condition is caused by mutations in the acta1 gene, it usually occurs in an autosomal dominant pattern. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  most other cases of congenital fiber-type disproportion, including those caused by mutations in the ryr1 gene, have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  when this condition is caused by mutations in the tpm3 gene, it can occur in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern.  in rare cases, this condition can be inherited in an x-linked pattern, although the gene or genes associated with x-linked congenital fiber-type disproportion have not been identified. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. because females have two copies of the x chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males or may cause no symptoms at all. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  it is estimated that 40 percent of individuals with congenital fiber-type disproportion have an affected relative."
is horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) beriberi ?,"beriberi is a condition that occurs in people who are deficient in thiamine (vitamin b1). there are two major types of beriberi: wet beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry beriberi which affects the nervous system. people with wet beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. signs and symptoms of dry beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. beriberi is rare in the united states since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. in most cases, beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. a rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods. treatment generally includes thiamine supplementation, given by injection or taken by mouth."
what to do for indigestion ?,"- indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a term used to describe one or more symptoms including a feeling of fullness during a meal, uncomfortable fullness after a meal, and burning or pain in the upper abdomen.  - indigestion can be caused by a condition in the digestive tract such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), peptic ulcer disease, cancer, or abnormality of the pancreas or bile ducts.  - sometimes a person has indigestion for which a cause cannot be found. this type of indigestion is called functional dyspepsia.  - indigestion and heartburn are different conditions, but a person can have symptoms of both.  - the doctor may order x rays; blood, breath, and stool tests; and an upper endoscopy with biopsies to diagnose indigestion.  - some people may experience relief from indigestion by making some lifestyle changes and decreasing stress.  - the doctor may prescribe antacids, h2 receptor antagonists (h2ras), proton pump inhibitors (ppis), prokinetics, or antibiotics to treat the symptoms of indigestion."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for guillain-barr syndrome ?,"scientists are concentrating on finding new treatments and refining existing ones. scientists are also looking at the workings of the immune system to find which cells are responsible for beginning and carrying out the attack on the nervous system. the fact that so many cases of guillain-barr begin after a viral or bacterial infection suggests that certain characteristics of some viruses and bacteria may activate the immune system inappropriately. investigators are searching for those characteristics. neurological scientists, immunologists, virologists, and pharmacologists are all working collaboratively to learn how to prevent this disorder and to make better therapies available when it strikes."
what are the symptoms of quinquaud's decalvans folliculitis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of quinquaud's decalvans folliculitis? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for quinquaud's decalvans folliculitis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) alopecia 90% pustule 90% skin ulcer 90% atypical scarring of skin 50% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
who is at risk for adult acute myeloid leukemia? ?,"smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult aml. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. possible risk factors for aml include the following:         - being male.    - smoking, especially after age 60.    - having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past.    - having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) in the past.    - being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene.    - having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome."
what are the treatments for atherosclerosis ?,"treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. the goals of treatment include:
                
lowering the risk of blood clots forming
                
preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases
                
reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque
                
relieving symptoms
                
widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries
                
heart-healthy lifestyle changes
                
your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking.
                
heart-healthy eating
                
your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
a lot of red meat
                
palm and coconut oils
                
sugary foods and beverages
                
two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. when you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. to help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
not all fats are bad. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
avocados
                
corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
peanut butter
                
salmon and trout
                
tofu
                
sodium
                
you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
dietary approaches to stop hypertension
                
your doctor may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about dash.
                
alcohol
                
try to limit alcohol intake. too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. one drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. aim for a healthy weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
knowing your body mass index (bmi) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. to figure out your bmi, check out the national heart, lung, and blood institutes online bmi calculator or talk to your doctor. a bmi:
                
below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
a bmi of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
a general goal to aim for is a bmi of less than 25. your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal.
                
measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. this risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk. for more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit aim for a healthy weight.
                
if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower ldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol.
                
managing stress
                
learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
a stress management program
                
meditation
                
physical activity
                
relaxation therapy
                
talking things out with friends or family
                
physical activity
                
regular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including ldl or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your hdl or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.
                
everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. read more about physical activity at:

quitting smoking
                
if you smoke or use tobacco, quit. smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
for more information about how to quit smoking, visit smoking and your heart.
                
medicines
                
sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. for example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. by lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke
                
diabetes
                
high ldl cholesterol levels
                
doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
lower your blood pressure
                
lower your blood sugar levels
                
prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke
                
prevent inflammation
                
take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. you should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.
                
medical procedures and surgery
                
if you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.
                
percutaneous coronary intervention (pci), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. pci can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.
                
coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) is a type of surgery. in cabg, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. cabg can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. for this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. the healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.
                
carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. this procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke."
what are the treatments for craniosynostosis ?,"treatment for craniosynostosis generally consists of surgery to improve the symmetry and appearance of the head and to relieve pressure on the brain and the cranial nerves. for some children with less severe problems, cranial molds can reshape the skull to accommodate brain growth and improve the appearance of the head."
what is (are) short qt syndrome ?,"short qt syndrome is a condition that can cause a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). in people with this condition, the heart (cardiac) muscle takes less time than usual to recharge between beats. the term ""short qt"" refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (ekg), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. in people with this condition, the part of the heartbeat known as the qt interval is abnormally short.  if untreated, the arrhythmia associated with short qt syndrome can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, from dizziness and fainting (syncope) to cardiac arrest and sudden death. these signs and symptoms can occur any time from early infancy to old age. this condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year. however, some people with short qt syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition."
is juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?,"how is juvenile retinoschisis inherited? juvenile retinoschisis is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a striking characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene (mutation) in each cell is called a carrier. she can pass on the mutation, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the condition. carrier women have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to their children, males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and will nearly always have normal vision. carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known."

what is (are) alpha-thalassemia ?,"alpha-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. affected people have anemia, which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. two types of alpha-thalassemia can cause health problems: the more severe type is known as hb bart syndrome; the milder form is called hbh disease. hb bart syndrome may be characterized by hydrops fetalis; severe anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; heart defects; and abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia. most babies with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth. hbh disease may cause mild to moderate anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; jaundice; or bone changes. alpha-thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the hba1 and hba2 genes. the inheritance is complex, and can be read about here. no treatment is effective for hb bart syndrome. for hbh disease, occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed."
what are the treatments for gum (periodontal) disease ?,"controlling the infection the main goal of treatment is to control the infection. the number and types of treatment will vary, depending on how far the disease has advanced. any type of treatment requires the patient to keep up good daily care at home. the doctor may also suggest changing certain behaviors, such as quitting smoking, as a way to improve treatment outcome. treatments may include deep cleaning, medications, surgery, and bone and tissue grafts. deep cleaning (scaling and planing) in deep cleaning, the dentist, periodontist, or dental hygienist removes the plaque through a method called scaling and root planing. scaling means scraping off the tartar from above and below the gum line. root planing gets rid of rough spots on the tooth root where the germs gather, and helps remove bacteria that contribute to the disease. in some cases a laser may be used to remove plaque and tartar. this procedure can result in less bleeding, swelling, and discomfort compared to traditional deep cleaning methods. medications medications may be used with treatment that includes scaling and root planing, but they cannot always take the place of surgery. depending on how far the disease has progressed, the dentist or periodontist may still suggest surgical treatment. long-term studies are needed to find out if using medications reduces the need for surgery and whether they are effective over a long period of time. flap surgery surgery might be necessary if inflammation and deep pockets remain following treatment with deep cleaning and medications. a dentist or periodontist may perform flap surgery to remove tartar deposits in deep pockets or to reduce the periodontal pocket and make it easier for the patient, dentist, and hygienist to keep the area clean. this common surgery involves lifting back the gums and removing the tartar. the gums are then sutured back in place so that the tissue fits snugly around the tooth again. after surgery, the gums will shrink to fit more tightly around the tooth. this sometimes results in the teeth appearing longer. bone and tissue grafts in addition to flap surgery, your periodontist or dentist may suggest procedures to help regenerate any bone or gum tissue lost to periodontitis. - bone grafting,  in which natural or synthetic bone is placed in the area of bone loss, can help promote bone growth. a technique that can be used with bone grafting is called guided tissue regeneration. in this procedure, a small piece of mesh-like material is inserted between the bone and gum tissue. this keeps the gum tissue from growing into the area where the bone should be, allowing the bone and connective tissue to regrow. bone grafting,  in which natural or synthetic bone is placed in the area of bone loss, can help promote bone growth. a technique that can be used with bone grafting is called guided tissue regeneration. in this procedure, a small piece of mesh-like material is inserted between the bone and gum tissue. this keeps the gum tissue from growing into the area where the bone should be, allowing the bone and connective tissue to regrow. - growth factors  proteins that can help your body naturally regrow bone  may also be used. in cases where gum tissue has been lost, your dentist or periodontist may suggest a soft tissue graft, in which synthetic material or tissue taken from another area of your mouth is used to cover exposed tooth roots. growth factors  proteins that can help your body naturally regrow bone  may also be used. in cases where gum tissue has been lost, your dentist or periodontist may suggest a soft tissue graft, in which synthetic material or tissue taken from another area of your mouth is used to cover exposed tooth roots. since each case is different, it is not possible to predict with certainty which grafts will be successful over the long-term. treatment results depend on many things, including how far the disease has progressed, how well the patient keeps up with oral care at home, and certain risk factors, such as smoking, which may lower the chances of success. ask your periodontist what the level of success might be in your particular case. treatment results treatment results depend on many things, including how far the disease has progressed, how well the patient keeps up with home care, and certain risk factors, such as smoking, which may lower the chances of success. ask your periodontist what the likelihood of success might be in your particular case. consider getting a second opinion when considering any extensive dental or medical treatment options, you should think about getting a second opinion. to find a dentist or periodontist for a second opinion, call your local dental society. they can provide you with names of practitioners in your area. also, dental schools may sometimes be able to offer a second opinion. call the dental school in your area to find out whether it offers this service."

what causes pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"what causes pityriasis rubra pilaris? in most cases, pityriasis rubra pilaris (prp) occurs sporadically for unknown reasons. in a few families with the inherited form, familial prp, the condition is caused by mutations in the card14 gene. this gene gives instructions for making a protein that turns on other proteins that regulate genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. it also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct. the card14 protein is particularly abundant in the skin. mutations in the gene can cause a person to have an abnormal inflammatory response. researchers are trying to find out how these mutations cause the specific features of familial prp."
how to prevent q fever ?,"in the united states, q fever outbreaks have resulted mainly from occupational exposure involving veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy workers, livestock farmers, and researchers at facilities housing sheep. prevention and control efforts should be directed primarily toward these groups and environments. 
 
the following measures should be used in the prevention and control of q fever: 
  
  - educate the public on sources of infection.  
  - appropriately dispose of placenta, birth products, fetal membranes, and aborted fetuses at facilities housing sheep and goats.  
  - restrict access to barns and laboratories used in housing potentially infected animals.   
  - use appropriate procedures for bagging, autoclaving, and washing of laboratory clothing.  
  - vaccinate (where possible) individuals engaged in research with pregnant sheep or live c. burnetii.  
  - quarantine imported animals.  
  - ensure that holding facilities for sheep should be located away from populated areas. animals should be routinely tested for antibodies to c. burnetii, and measures should be implemented to prevent airflow to other occupied areas.  
  - counsel persons at highest risk for developing chronic q fever, especially persons with pre-existing cardiac valvular disease or individuals with vascular grafts.  
  
 
a vaccine for q fever has been developed and has successfully protected humans in occupational settings in australia. however, this vaccine is not commercially available in the united states. persons wishing to be vaccinated should first have a skin test to determine a history of previous exposure. individuals who have previously been exposed to c. burnetii should not receive the vaccine because severe reactions, localized to the area of the injected vaccine, may occur. a vaccine for use in animals has also been developed, but it is not available in the united states. 
 significance for bioterrorism 
 
coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious agent that is rather resistant to heat and drying. it can become airborne and inhaled by humans. a single c. burnetii organism may cause disease in a susceptible person. this agent has a past history of being developed for use in biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat."

what is (are) shoulder injuries and disorders ?,"your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone). your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. they can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. to remain in a stable or normal position, the shoulder must be anchored by muscles, tendons and ligaments. because the shoulder can be unstable, it is the site of many common problems. they include sprains, strains, dislocations, separations, tendinitis, bursitis, torn rotator cuffs, frozen shoulder, fractures and arthritis.     usually shoulder problems are treated with rice. this stands for rest, ice, compression and elevation. other treatments include exercise, medicines to reduce pain and swelling, and surgery if other treatments don't work.    nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases"
what is (are) urine blockage in newborns ?,"the urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra fluid. the urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. children produce less urine than adults. the amount produced depends on their age. the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. when the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.
                
the kidneys and urinary system keep fluids and natural chemicals in the body balanced. while a baby is developing in the mothers womb, called prenatal development, the placentaa temporary organ joining mother and babycontrols much of that balance. the babys kidneys begin to produce urine at about 10 to 12 weeks after conception. however, the mothers placenta continues to do most of the work until the last few weeks of the pregnancy. wastes and extra water are removed from the babys body through the umbilical cord. the babys urine is released into the amniotic sac and becomes part of the amniotic fluid. this fluid plays a role in the babys lung development."
what are the genetic changes related to retinitis pigmentosa ?,"mutations in more than 60 genes are known to cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa. more than 20 of these genes are associated with the autosomal dominant form of the disorder. mutations in the rho gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, accounting for 20 to 30 percent of all cases. at least 35 genes have been associated with the autosomal recessive form of the disorder. the most common of these is ush2a; mutations in this gene are responsible for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. changes in at least six genes are thought to cause the x-linked form of the disorder. together, mutations in the rpgr and rp2 genes account for most cases of x-linked retinitis pigmentosa.  the genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa play essential roles in the structure and function of specialized light receptor cells (photoreceptors) in the retina. the retina contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. rods are responsible for vision in low light, while cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision.  mutations in any of the genes responsible for retinitis pigmentosa lead to a gradual loss of rods and cones in the retina. the progressive degeneration of these cells causes the characteristic pattern of vision loss that occurs in people with retinitis pigmentosa. rods typically break down before cones, which is why night vision impairment is usually the first sign of the disorder. daytime vision is disrupted later, as both rods and cones are lost.  some of the genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa are also associated with other eye diseases, including a condition called cone-rod dystrophy. cone-rod dystrophy has signs and symptoms similar to those of retinitis pigmentosa. however, cone-rod dystrophy is characterized by deterioration of the cones first, followed by the rods, so daylight and color vision are affected before night vision."

what are the genetic changes related to d-bifunctional protein deficiency ?,"d-bifunctional protein deficiency is caused by mutations in the hsd17b4 gene. the protein produced from this gene (d-bifunctional protein) is an enzyme, which means that it helps specific biochemical reactions to take place. the d-bifunctional protein is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances. the d-bifunctional protein is involved in the breakdown of certain molecules called fatty acids. the protein has two separate regions (domains) with enzyme activity, called the hydratase and dehydrogenase domains. these domains help carry out the second and third steps, respectively, of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. this process shortens the fatty acid molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the fatty acids are converted to a molecule called acetyl-coa, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.  hsd17b4 gene mutations that cause d-bifunctional protein deficiency can affect one or both of the protein's functions; however, this distinction does not seem to affect the severity or features of the disorder. impairment of one or both of the protein's enzymatic activities prevents the d-bifunctional protein from breaking down fatty acids efficiently. as a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. it is unclear how fatty acid accumulation leads to the specific neurological and non-neurological features of d-bifunctional protein deficiency. however, the accumulation may result in abnormal development of the brain and the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. abnormal brain development and leukodystrophy likely underlie the neurological abnormalities that occur in d-bifunctional protein deficiency."

what are the genetic changes related to auriculo-condylar syndrome ?,"auriculo-condylar syndrome can be caused by mutations in either the gnai3 or plcb4 gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in chemical signaling within cells. they help transmit information from outside the cell to inside the cell, which instructs the cell to grow, divide, or take on specialized functions.  studies suggest that the proteins produced from the gnai3 and plcb4 genes contribute to the development of the first and second pharyngeal arches, which are structures in the embryo that ultimately develop into the jawbones, facial muscles, middle ear bones, ear canals, outer ears, and related tissues. mutations in these genes alter the formation of the lower jaw: instead of developing normally, the lower jaw becomes shaped more like the smaller upper jaw (maxilla). this abnormal shape leads to micrognathia and problems with tmj function. researchers are working to determine how mutations in these genes lead to the other developmental abnormalities associated with auriculo-condylar syndrome.  in some people with the characteristic features of auriculo-condylar syndrome, a mutation in the gnai3 or plcb4 gene has not been found. the cause of the condition is unknown in these individuals."
how to diagnose high blood pressure ?,"for most patients, health care providers diagnose high blood pressure when blood pressure readings areconsistently 140/90 mmhg or above.
                
confirming high blood pressure
                
a blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic. to prepare for the test:
                
dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test.
                
go to the bathroom before the test.
                
sit for 5 minutes before the test.
                
to track blood pressure readings over a period of time, the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure. the health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results.
                
whenever you have an appointment with the health care provider, be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings. every time you visit the health care provider, he or she should tell you what your blood pressure numbers are; if he or she does not, you should ask for your readings.
                
blood pressure severity and type
                
your health care provider usually takes 23 readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure. using the results of your blood pressure test, your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if:
                
your systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mmhg.
                
your childs blood pressure numbers are outside average numbers for children of the same age, gender, and height.
                
once your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure, he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure. health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan.
                
some people have white coat hypertension. this happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location. health care providers diagnose this type of high blood pressure by reviewing readings in the office and readings taken anywhere else. researchers believe stress, which can occur during the medical appointment, causes white coat hypertension."
how many people are affected by ochoa syndrome ?,ochoa syndrome is a rare disorder. about 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
what causes chronic diarrhea in children ?,"many diseases and disorders can cause chronic diarrhea in children. common causes include
                
- infections  - functional gastrointestinal (gi) disorders  - food allergies and intolerances  - inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)
                
infections, food allergies and intolerances, and ibd may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food. if children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished. functional gi disorders do not cause malabsorption.
                
infections
                
infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites sometimes lead to chronic diarrhea. after an infection, some children have problems digesting carbohydrates, such as lactose, or proteins, such as milk or soy proteins. these problems can cause prolonged diarrheaoften for up to 6 weeksafter an infection. also, some bacteria and parasite infections that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment.
                
more information about infections that cause diarrhea is provided in the niddk health topics:
                
- viral gastroenteritis  - foodborne illnesses
                
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also cause chronic diarrhea. normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine, and many bacteria live in the large intestine. small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. these bacteria can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and weight loss. small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as crohns disease or diabetes. small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also more common in people who have had abdominal surgery or who have slow-moving intestines.
                
functional gastrointestinal disorders
                
in functional gi disorders, symptoms are caused by changes in how the gi tract works. the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening through which stool leaves the body. the gi tract digests, or breaks down, food and processes solid waste.
                
children with a functional gi disorder have frequent symptoms, yet the gi tract does not become damaged. functional gi disorders are not diseases; they are groups of symptoms that occur together.
                
two functional gi disorders that cause chronic diarrhea in children are toddlers diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).
                
toddlers diarrhea. toddlers diarrheaalso called functional diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhoodis a common cause of chronic diarrhea in toddlers and preschool-age children. children with this disorder pass three or more loose stools a day and do not have any other symptoms. they typically are growing well and gaining weight, and are healthy.
                
toddlers diarrhea develops between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and it usually goes away on its own by the time children begin grade school. researchers think a diet with too much sugarsuch as the sugar found in fruit juicerelative to the amount of fat and fiber may cause toddlers diarrhea.
                
ibs. the most common symptoms of ibs are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea. the pain or discomfort of ibs typically gets better with the passage of stool or gas. ibs does not cause symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool.
                
possible causes include problems with nerves in the intestines, problems with nerve signals between the brain and the intestines, changes in how food moves through the intestines, and hypersensitivity to pain. psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, or food sensitivity may also play a role.
                
ibs is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in grade school-age children and adolescents. health care providers rarely diagnose ibs in younger children because younger children are not able to report symptoms of pain or discomfort. more information is provided in the niddk health topics:

food allergies and intolerances
                
food allergies, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and dietary fructose intolerance are common causes of chronic diarrhea.
                
food allergies. a food allergy is a reaction by the immune system, the bodys natural defense system, to one or more proteins in certain foods. the immune system normally protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances that can cause illness. in food allergies, however, the immune system responds abnormally to certain foods.
                
cows milk and soy allergies are the most common food allergies that affect the gi tract in children. food allergies usually appear in the first year of life. many children outgrow cows milk and soy allergies by age 3. allergies to other foods, such as cereal grains, eggs, or seafood, may also affect the gi tract.
                
symptoms of food allergies may include diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss or poor weight gain. some children have mild symptoms, while others have severe or life-threatening symptoms. for example, some children have severe vomiting and diarrhea that lead to dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly.
                
celiac disease. celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten. a chronic reaction to gluten damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, communion wafers, and certain medications.
                
children of any age can experience digestive symptoms of celiac disease or have symptoms in other parts of the body. digestive symptoms can include
                
- chronic diarrhea  - abdominal bloating  - stomach pain  - gas  - vomiting  - constipation  - pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool
                
malabsorption of nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a childs normal growth and development can result in other health problems. these problems may include
                
- failure to thrive in infants  - slowed growth and short stature  - weight loss  - irritability or mood changes  - delayed puberty  - dental enamel defects of the permanent teeth  - anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen  - low levels of important nutrients such as iron and calcium

lactose intolerance. lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming milk or milk products. lactose is a sugar found in milk or milk products. lactase, an enzyme produced by the small intestine, breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar: glucose and galactose. the bloodstream then absorbs these simpler sugars.
                
some children have a lactase deficiency, meaning the small intestine produces low levels of lactase and cannot digest much lactose. lactase deficiency may cause lactose malabsorption. in children with lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the lactose and create fluid and gas.
                
not all children with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms. experts use the term lactose intolerance when lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption cause digestive symptoms.
                
the most common type of lactase deficiency develops over time, beginning after about age 2, when the body begins to produce less lactase. children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood.
                
infants rarely have lactose intolerance at birth. people sometimes mistake cows milk allergy, which can cause diarrhea in infants, for lactose intolerance. congenital lactase deficiencyan extremely rare inherited genetic disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme at birthcan cause lactose intolerance in infants. premature infants may experience lactose intolerance for a short time after birth. children of any age may develop temporary lactose intolerance after a viral diarrheal episode or other infection.

dietary fructose intolerance. dietary fructose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming foods that contain fructose. fructose is a sugar found in fruits, fruit juices, and honey. fructose is also added to many foods and soft drinks as a sweetener called high fructose corn syrup.
                
fructose malabsorption causes dietary fructose intolerance. the small intestine absorbs fructose, and, when a person consumes more fructose than the small intestine can absorb, fructose malabsorption results. unabsorbed fructose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the fructose and create fluid and gas.
                
the amount of fructose that a childs small intestine can absorb varies. the capacity of the small intestine to absorb fructose increases with age. some children may be able to tolerate more fructose as they get older.
                
another type of fructose intolerance, hereditary fructose intolerance, is not related to fructose malabsorption. hereditary fructose intolerance is an extremely rare inherited genetic disorder. children with this disorder lack an enzyme needed to break down fructose. symptoms of hereditary fructose intolerance may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. this disorder can also damage the liver and kidneys.
                
inflammatory bowel disease
                
inflammatory bowel disease causes irritation and inflammation in the intestines. the two main types of ibd are ulcerative colitis and crohns disease. these disorders can affect children at any age; however, they commonly begin in the grade school years or in adolescence. the causes of ibd are unknown. researchers believe they result from an abnormal immune system reaction.
                
ulcerative colitis. ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine. the large intestine includes the colon and the rectumthe lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus. normally, the large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid. in ulcerative colitis, the inflammation causes loss of the lining of the large intestine, leading to bleeding, production of pus, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic, ulcerative colitis.
                
crohns disease. crohns disease is a disease that causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the gi tract. the end part of the small intestine, called the ileum, is most commonly affected. in crohns disease, inflammation can extend through the entire wall of the gi tract, leading to possible complications. swelling can cause pain and can make the intestine empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea.

                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     targeted therapy      targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. several types of targeted therapy are being studied in the treatment of gi carcinoid tumors.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what causes lung cancer ?,"some studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, are at increased risk of lung cancer. secondhand smoke is the smoke that non-smokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking. tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer. since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke.  learn more about the effects of secondhand smoke.  learn more about the chemicals found in cigarettes."

what are the genetic changes related to trichothiodystrophy ?,"most cases of the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy result from mutations in one of three genes: ercc2, ercc3, or gtf2h5. the proteins produced from these genes work together as part of a group of proteins called the general transcription factor iih (tfiih) complex. this complex is involved in the repair of dna damage, which can be caused by uv radiation from the sun. the tfiih complex also plays an important role in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production.  mutations in the ercc2, ercc3, or gtf2h5 genes reduce the amount of tfiih complex within cells, which impairs both dna repair and gene transcription. an inability to repair dna damage probably underlies the sun sensitivity in affected individuals. studies suggest that many of the other features of trichothiodystrophy may result from problems with the transcription of genes needed for normal development before and after birth.  mutations in at least one gene, mplkip, have been reported to cause a non-photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy. mutations in this gene account for fewer than 20 percent of all cases of non-photosensitive trichothiodystrophy. little is known about the protein produced from the mplkip gene, although it does not appear to be involved in dna repair. it is unclear how mutations in the mplkip gene lead to the varied features of trichothiodystrophy.  in some cases, the genetic cause of trichothiodystrophy is unknown."
what are the treatments for tethered spinal cord syndrome ?,"mri imaging is often used to evaluate individuals with these symptoms, and can be used to diagnose the location of the tethering, lower than normal position of the conus medullaris, or presence of a tumor or fatty mass (lipoma). in children, early surgery is recommended to prevent further neurological deterioration. regular follow-up is important: retethering may occur in some individuals during periods of rapid growth and may be seen between five to nine years of age. if surgery is not advisable, spinal cord nerve roots may be cut to relieve pain. in adults, surgery to free (detether) the spinal cord can reduce the size and further development of cysts in the cord and may restore some function or alleviate other symptoms. other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."

what are the symptoms of renal nutcracker syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of renal nutcracker syndrome? the signs and symptoms of renal nutcracker syndrome and the disease severity can vary from person to person. some affected people may be asymptomatic while others have severe and persistent symptoms. symptoms are often aggravated by physical activity. when present, symptoms of the condition may include blood in the urine (hematuria), orthostatic proteinuria, flank pain and/or abdominal pain. some people may also experience orthostatic intolerance, which is characterized by symptoms such as light-headedness, palpitations, poor concentration, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, sweating, weakness and occasionally fainting when upright standing. men who are affected by renal nutcracker syndrome may develop a varicocele. affected women may have gynecological symptoms such as dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea (painful periods)."
what are the genetic changes related to african iron overload ?,"african iron overload was first noted in rural central and southern african populations among people who drink a traditional beer brewed in uncoated steel drums that allow iron (a component of steel) to leach into the beer. however, not all individuals who drink the beer develop african iron overload, and not all individuals of african descent with iron overload drink the beer. therefore, researchers are seeking genetic differences that affect the risk of developing this condition.  some studies have indicated that a variation in the slc40a1 gene increases the risk of developing increased iron stores in people of african descent. this variation is found in 5 to 20 percent of people of african descent but is not generally found in other populations.  the slc40a1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ferroportin. this protein is involved in the process of iron absorption in the body. iron from the diet is absorbed through the walls of the small intestine. ferroportin then transports iron from the small intestine into the bloodstream, and the iron is carried by the blood to the tissues and organs of the body. ferroportin also transports iron out of reticuloendothelial cells in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. the amount of iron absorbed by the body depends on the amount of iron stored and released from intestinal cells and macrophages.  the slc40a1 gene variation that some studies have associated with increased iron stores in people of african descent may affect the way ferroportin helps to regulate iron absorption in the body. however, researchers suggest that this variation is not associated with most cases of african iron overload."
how to diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"to diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. a health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. a health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis. the health care provider also will look for the cause of the condition, such as an underlying illness.
                
intestinal pseudo-obstruction can be difficult to diagnose, especially primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. as a result, a correct diagnosis may take a long time.
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body
                
medical history
                
the health care provider will ask a person to provide a medical and family history to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
                
imaging studies
                
a health care provider may order the following imaging studies:
                
- abdominal x ray. an x ray is a picture recorded on film or a computer that a technician takes using low-level radiation. the amount of radiation used is small. an x-ray technician takes the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. a person does not need anesthesia. the person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. the technician positions the x-ray machine over the abdominal area. the person will hold his or her breath as the technician takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. the technician may ask the person to change position for additional pictures. an x ray of the abdominal area will show whether symptoms are due to an intestinal blockage.  - upper gi series. a health care provider may order an upper gi series to look at the small intestine. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images; the health care provider may give infants and children anesthesia. a person should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. during the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. infants lie on a table and the technician will give them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. barium coats the lining of the small intestine, making signs of obstruction show up more clearly on x rays.  a person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. barium liquid in the gi tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. a health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - lower gi series. a health care provider may order a lower gi series, an x-ray exam to look at the large intestine. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. a person does not need anesthesia. the health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. the health care provider may ask the person to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. a person may need to use a laxative or an enema before the test. a laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. an enema involves flushing water or laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle.  for the test, the person will lie on a table while the health care provider inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. the health care provider will fill the large intestine with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. the test can show problems with the large intestine that are causing the persons symptoms.  barium liquid in the gi tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. a health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - computerized tomography (ct) scan. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. for a ct scan, a health care provider may give the person a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays. ct scans can show both the internal and external intestinal wall. the health care provider may give children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test.  - upper gi endoscopy. this procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. a gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. the gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. a health care provider may give a person a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the persons throat. a health care provider will place an intravenous (iv) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. this test can show blockages or other conditions in the upper small intestine. a gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsy of the lining of the small intestine during an upper gi endoscopy.
                
biopsy
                
a gastroenterologist can obtain a biopsy of the intestinal wall during endoscopy or during surgery, if the person has surgery for intestinal pseudo-obstruction and the cause is unknown. if the health care provider needs to examine the nerves in the intestinal wall, a deeper biopsy, which a gastroenterologist can typically obtain only during surgery, is necessary.
                
a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of the intestinal wall tissue for examination with a microscope. a health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital and uses light sedation and local anesthetic; the health care provider uses general anesthesia if performing the biopsy during surgery. a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the intestinal tissue in a lab. diagnosing problems in the nerve pathways of the intestinal tissue requires special techniques that are not widely available.
                
a health care provider can also use a biopsy obtained during endoscopy to rule out celiac disease. celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in products such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and certain medications.
                
blood tests
                
a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show the presence of other diseases or conditions that may be causing a persons symptoms. the blood test also can show levels of essential vitamins and minerals to help detect malnutrition.
                
manometry
                
manometry is a test that measures muscle pressure and movements in the gi tract, such as how well the smooth muscles of the stomach and small intestine contract and relax. a gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. while the person is under sedation, a health care provider places a thin tube, or manometry tube, into the stomach and moves it down into the small intestine. a gastroenterologist may use an endoscope to place this tube. a health care provider will move the person to a manometry room and connect the manometry tube to a computer. when the person wakes up from sedation, the computer records the pressure inside the intestine while the person is fasting and after the person has eaten a meal. manometry can confirm the diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction and show the extent of the condition.
                
gastric emptying tests
                
gastric emptying tests can show if a disorder called gastroparesis is causing a persons symptoms. people with gastroparesis, which literally refers to a paralyzed stomach, have severely delayed gastric emptying, or the delayed movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. some patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction also have gastroparesis.
                
types of gastric emptying tests include the following:
                
- gastric emptying scintigraphy. this test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. a specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the results; the person does not need anesthesia. an external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. the radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. normal values depend on the composition of the meal. with some meals, if more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, a health care provider confirms the diagnosis of gastroparesis. obtaining scans for 4 hours after the meal is essential. when the technician only obtains scans 1 to 2 hours after the meal, the results are often unreliable.  - breath test. with this test, the person eats a meal containing a small amount of nonradioactive material. then, the health care provider takes breath samples over a period of several hours to measure the amount of nonradioactive material in the exhaled breath. the results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.  - smartpill. the smartpill is a small electronic device in capsule form. the smartpill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. the person swallows the device so that it can move through the entire digestive tract and send information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck. the recorded information provides details about how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract."
what is (are) pseudotumor cerebri ?,"pseudotumor cerebri literally means ""false brain tumor."" it is likely due to high pressure within the skull caused by the buildup or poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the disorder is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 50. symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri, which include headache, nausea, vomiting, and pulsating sounds within the head, closely mimic symptoms of large brain tumors."
is succinyl-coa:3-ketoacid coa transferase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) dry mouth ?,"saliva does more than keep your mouth wet. it helps digest food, protects teeth from decay, helps to heal sores in your mouth, and prevents infection by controlling bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the mouth. saliva is also what helps us chew and swallow. each of these functions of saliva is hampered when a person has dry mouth."
what is (are) retinal disorders ?,"the retina is a layer of tissue in the back of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain. in the center of this nerve tissue is the macula. it provides the sharp, central vision needed for reading, driving and seeing fine detail.    retinal disorders affect this vital tissue. they can affect your vision, and some can be serious enough to cause blindness. examples are       - macular degeneration - a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision    - diabetic eye disease    - retinal detachment - a medical emergency, when the retina is pulled away from the back of the eye    - retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina. it is most common in young children.    - macular pucker - scar tissue on the macula    - macular hole - a small break in the macula that usually happens to people over 60    - floaters - cobwebs or specks in your field of vision       nih: national eye institute"
what is (are) holoprosencephaly ?,"holoprosencephaly is a disorder caused by the failure of the prosencephalon (the embryonic forebrain) to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. the result is a single-lobed brain structure and severe skull and facial defects. in most cases of holoprosencephaly, the malformations are so severe that babies die before birth. in less severe cases, babies are born with normal or near-normal brain development and facial deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip.
                
there are three classifications of holoprosencephaly. alobar, in which the brain has not divided at all, is usually associated with severe facial deformities. semilobar, in which the brain's hemispheres have somewhat divided, causes an intermediate form of the disorder. lobar, in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain hemispheres, is the least severe form. in some cases of lobar holoprosencephaly the baby's brain may be nearly normal.
                
the least severe of the facial anomalies is the median cleft lip (premaxillary agenesis). the most severe is cyclopia, an abnormality characterized by a single eye located in the area normally occupied by the root of the nose, and a missing nose or a proboscis (a tubular-shaped nose) located above the eye. the least common facial anomaly is ethmocephaly, in which a proboscis separates closely-set eyes. cebocephaly, another facial anomaly, is characterized by a small, flattened nose with a single nostril situated below incomplete or underdeveloped closely-set eyes."
is juvenile primary lateral sclerosis inherited ?,"when caused by mutations in the als2 gene, juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) kidney diseases ?,"your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists. they are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood. they remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. the urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.     most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. this damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. you are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. other kidney problems include:       - cancer    - cysts    - stones    - infections       your doctor can run tests to find out if you have kidney disease. if your kidneys fail completely, a kidney transplant or dialysis can replace the work your kidneys normally do.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ?,"ninds supports research on gene-linked disorders, including the leukodystrophies. the goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure them."
what are the stages of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary ?,"key points
                    - after metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.    - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                
                
                    after metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. the results from tests and procedures used to detect and diagnose the primary tumor are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.    there is no standard staging system for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. the tumors are described as untreated or recurrent. untreated metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is cancer that is newly diagnosed and has not been treated, except to relieve signs and symptoms caused by the cancer.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."

what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. if you have too much phosphorus in your blood, it pulls calcium from your bones. losing calcium will make your bones weak and likely to break. also, too much phosphorus may make your skin itch. foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus. usually, people on dialysis are limited to 1/2 cup of milk per day. the renal dietitian will give you more specific information regarding phosphorus.
                
you probably will need to take a phosphate binder like renagel, phoslo, tums, or calcium carbonate to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. because it is bound, the phosphorus does not get into the blood. instead, it is passed out of the body in the stool."

what are the treatments for porokeratosis of mibelli ?,"how might porokeratosis of mibelli be treated? treatment depends on the size, location, and aggressiveness of porokeratosis of mibelli.  affected individuals are recommended to visit their personal physician regularly to watch for signs of skin cancer, limit sun exposure to the affected area, and use moisturizers as needed.  imiquimod cream has been found to be an effective treatment, as has 5-fluorouracil cream.  a group of medications called retinoids (including acitretin and isotretinoin), as a pill or cream, may be another treatment option.  if a skin cancer develops from porokeratosis of mibelli, surgery is recommended."
what is (are) fryns syndrome ?,"fryns syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body. the features of this disorder vary widely among affected individuals and overlap with the signs and symptoms of several other disorders. these factors can make fryns syndrome difficult to diagnose.  most people with fryns syndrome have a defect in the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm). the most common defect is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which is a hole in the diaphragm that develops before birth. this hole allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest and crowd the heart and lungs. as a result, the lungs often do not develop properly (pulmonary hypoplasia), which can cause life-threatening breathing difficulties in affected infants.  other major signs of fryns syndrome include abnormalities of the fingers and toes and distinctive facial features. the tips of the fingers and toes tend to be underdeveloped, resulting in a short and stubby appearance with small or absent nails. most affected individuals have several unusual facial features, including widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a broad and flat nasal bridge, a thick nasal tip, a wide space between the nose and upper lip (a long philtrum), a large mouth (macrostomia), and a small chin (micrognathia). many also have low-set and abnormally shaped ears.  several additional features have been reported in people with fryns syndrome. these include small eyes (microphthalmia), clouding of the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the lip (cleft lip). fryns syndrome can also affect the development of the brain, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and genitalia.  most people with fryns syndrome die before birth or in early infancy from pulmonary hypoplasia caused by a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. however, a few affected individuals have lived into childhood. many of these children have had severe developmental delay and intellectual disability."
how to diagnose polycythemia vera ?,"special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera. in addition to a complete blood count, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and cytogenetic analysis, a serum erythropoietin test is used to diagnose polycythemia vera. in this test, a sample of blood is checked for the level of erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates new red blood cells to be made). in polycythemia vera, the erythropoietin level would be lower than normal because the body does not need to make more red blood cells."
what is (are) progeria ?,"progeria is a rare condition characterized by dramatic, rapid aging beginning in childhood. affected newborns usually appear normal but within a year, their growth rate slows significantly. affected children develop a distinctive appearance characterized by baldness, aged-looking skin, a pinched nose, and a small face and jaw relative to head size. they also often have symptoms typically seen in much older people including joint stiffness, hip dislocations and severe, progressive cardiovascular disease. intelligence is typically normal. the average lifespan is age 13-14; death is usually due to heart attack or stroke. progeria is caused by mutations in the lmna gene, but almost always results from a new mutation rather than being inherited from a parent. management focuses on the individual signs and symptoms of the condition. although there is currently no cure, research involving treatment is ongoing and progress is being made."

what are the treatments for anxiety disorders ?,"exposure-based treatment has been used for many years to treat specific phobias. the person gradually encounters the object or situation that is feared, perhaps at first only through pictures or tapes, then later face-to-face. sometimes the therapist will accompany the person to a feared situation to provide support and guidance. exposure exercises are undertaken once the patient decides he is ready for it and with his cooperation. to be effective, therapy must be directed at the persons specific anxieties and must be tailored to his or her needs. a typical side effect is temporary discomfort involved with thinking about confronting feared situations."
is multiple familial trichoepithelioma inherited ?,"how is multiple familial trichoepithelioma inherited? susceptibility to multiple familial trichoepithelioma has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. this means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell increases the risk that a person will develop the condition. however, a second, non-inherited mutation is needed for development of the skin tumors characteristic of this condition."

is 15q13.3 microdeletion inherited ?,"15q13.3 microdeletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the deleted region on chromosome 15 in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of intellectual disability and other characteristic features.  in about 75 percent of cases, individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion inherit the chromosomal change from a parent. in the remaining cases, 15q13.3 microdeletion occurs in people whose parents do not carry the chromosomal change. in these individuals, the deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development."
how to diagnose crest syndrome ?,"how is crest syndrome diagnosed? crest syndrome can be difficult to diagnose. signs and symptoms vary widely and often resemble those of other connective tissue and autoimmune diseases. further complicating matters is that limited scleroderma sometimes occurs with other autoimmune conditions  such as polymyositis, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.   a blood sample can be tested for antibodies that are frequently found in the blood of people with limited scleroderma. but this isn't a definitive test because not everyone with limited scleroderma has these antibodies. sometimes doctors take a small sample of skin that's then examined under a microscope in a laboratory. biopsies can be helpful, but they can't definitively diagnose limited scleroderma either.  along with a blood test and skin biopsy, additional tests to identify lung, heart or gastrointestinal complications may also be conducted."
how many people are affected by hypomyelination and congenital cataract ?,the prevalence of hypomyelination and congenital cataract is unknown.
what are the treatments for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?,"how might hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be treated? the best treatment options for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh) are determined by a number of factors, including the severity of symptoms, the age of onset, and the underlying cause of the condition. in acquired hlh, it is often necessary to treat the underlying condition. for example, antiobiotics or antiviral medications can be used to treat or prevent infections that may have triggered the exaggerated immune response. allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is considered a cure for familial hlh. it is often recommended that people with confirmed or suspected familial hlh undergo this treatment as early in life as possible. prior to hematopoietic cell transplanation, affected people are usually treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy to destroy excess immune cells which can lead to life-threatening inflammation."

what causes relapsing polychondritis ?,"what causes relapsing polychondritis? the exact underlying cause of relapsing polychondritis (rp) is unknown. however, scientists suspect that it is an autoimmune condition. it it thought that rp occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cartilage and other tissues. in general, autoimmune conditions are complex traits that are associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. there is also evidence to suggest that some people may be born with a genetic susceptibility to rp. studies have found that people with rp are roughly twice as likely as those without this condition to carry a certain genetic allele called hla-dr4. ""hla"" stands for human leukocyte antigen, which is an important part of our immune system and plays a role in resistance and predisposition (risk) to disease. however, hla genes are not solely responsible for specific diseases but instead may simply contribute along with other genetic or environmental factors to disease risk. thus, many people with hla-dr4 will never develop rp."
what are the treatments for dystonias ?,"no one treatment has been found to be universally effective. instead, doctors use a variety of therapies (medications, surgery, and other treatments such as physical therapy, splinting, stress management, and biofeedback) aimed at reducing or eliminating muscle spasms and pain. since response to drugs varies among individuals and even in the same person over time, the most effective therapy is often individualized."
what is (are) beare-stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome ?,"beare-stevenson  cutis gyrata syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by skin abnormalities (cutis gyrata, which causes a furrowed and wrinkled appearance, and acanthosis nigricans) and the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). this early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. beare-stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is caused by mutations in the fgfr2 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although all reported cases have resulted from new mutations in the gene and occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what is (are) knee replacement ?,"there are many different types and designs of artificial knees. most consist of three components: -  the femoral component, which is the part that attaches to the thigh bone  - the tibial component, the part that attaches to the shin bone   - the patellar component, the knee cap. the femoral component, which is the part that attaches to the thigh bone the tibial component, the part that attaches to the shin bone the patellar component, the knee cap. total and partial knee replacement knee replacement may be either total or partial/unicompartmental. in total knee replacement, as the name suggests, the entire knee joint is replaced. you will likely need a total knee replacement if you have damage to several parts of your knee. in partial/unicompartmental knee replacement, the surgeon replaces just the damaged part of the knee. you may be able to have a partial knee replacement if only one section of your knee is damaged. however, when one part is replaced, there is a chance that another part will develop arthritis, requiring further surgery. cemented and uncemented joint components joint components may also be attached to your own bone in different ways. most are cemented with a special joint glue into your existing bone; others rely on a process called biologic fixation to hold them in place. this means that the parts are made with a porous surface, and over time your own bone grows into the joint surface to secure them. in some cases, surgeons use a combination of cemented and uncemented parts. this is referred to as a hybrid implant. minimally invasive surgery while some knee replacement surgery requires an 8- to 12-inch incision in the front of the knee, surgeons at many medical centers are now performing what is called minimally invasive surgery using incisions of 3 to 5 inches or even smaller. because the incision is smaller, there may be less pain and a shorter recovery time. if you think you might be interested in minimally invasive surgery, speak with your surgeon."
what is (are) monkeypox virus infections ?,"monkeypox is a rare viral disease. it occurs mostly in central and western africa. wild rodents and squirrels carry it, but it is called monkeypox because scientists saw it first in lab monkeys. in 2003, it was reported in prairie dogs and humans in the u.s.     centers for disease control and prevention"

what is (are) shprintzen-goldberg syndrome ?,"shprintzen-goldberg syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. affected individuals have a combination of distinctive facial features and skeletal and neurological abnormalities.  a common feature in people with shprintzen-goldberg syndrome is craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of certain skull bones. this early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally. affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features, including a long, narrow head; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); protruding eyes (exophthalmos); outside corners of the eyes that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures); a high, narrow palate; a small lower jaw (micrognathia); and low-set ears that are rotated backward.  people with shprintzen-goldberg syndrome are often said to have a marfanoid habitus, because their bodies resemble those of people with a genetic condition called marfan syndrome. for example, they may have long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly), unusually long limbs, a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum), and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). people with shprintzen-goldberg syndrome can have other skeletal abnormalities, such as one or more fingers that are permanently bent (camptodactyly) and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility).  people with shprintzen-goldberg syndrome often have delayed development and mild to moderate intellectual disability.  other common features of shprintzen-goldberg syndrome include heart or brain abnormalities, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy, and a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia).  shprintzen-goldberg syndrome has signs and symptoms similar to those of marfan syndrome and another genetic condition called loeys-dietz syndrome. however, intellectual disability is more likely to occur in shprintzen-goldberg syndrome than in the other two conditions. in addition, heart abnormalities are more common and usually more severe in marfan syndrome and loeys-dietz syndrome."
is 22q13.3 deletion syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome are not inherited. the deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family, though they can pass the chromosome deletion to their children.  when 22q13.3 deletion syndrome is inherited, its inheritance pattern is considered autosomal dominant because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. about 15 to 20 percent of people with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome inherit a chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. in these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which a segment from one chromosome has traded places with a segment from another chromosome, but no genetic material is gained or lost. balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. individuals with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 22, which results in the health problems characteristic of this disorder."
what causes crohn's disease ?,"the exact cause of crohn's disease is unknown. researchers believe the following factors may play a role in causing crohn's disease:
                
- autoimmune reaction  - genes  - environment
                
autoimmune reaction. scientists believe one cause of crohn's disease may be an autoimmune reactionwhen a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. researchers believe bacteria or viruses can mistakenly trigger the immune system to attack the inner lining of the intestines. this immune system response causes the inflammation, leading to symptoms.
                
genes. crohn's disease sometimes runs in families. research has shown that people who have a parent or sibling with crohn's disease may be more likely to develop the disease. researchers continue to study the link between genes and crohn's disease.
                
environment. some studies suggest that certain things in the environment may increase the chance of a person getting crohn's disease, although the overall chance is low. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,1 antibiotics,2 and oral contraceptives2 may slightly increase the chance of developing crohn's disease. a high-fat diet may also slightly increase the chance of getting crohn's disease.3
                
some people incorrectly believe that eating certain foods, stress, or emotional distress can cause crohn's disease. emotional distress and eating certain foods do not cause crohn's disease. sometimes the stress of living with crohn's disease can make symptoms worse. also, some people may find that certain foods can trigger or worsen their symptoms."
what are the genetic changes related to adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency ?,"mutations in the aprt gene cause aprt deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making aprt, an enzyme that helps to convert a dna building block (nucleotide) called adenine to a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (amp). this conversion occurs when amp is needed as a source of energy for cells.  aprt gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal aprt enzyme with reduced function or prevent the production of any enzyme. a lack of functional enzyme impairs the conversion of adenine to amp. as a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-dha). 2,8-dha crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. 2,8-dha crystals are brownish in color, which explains why affected infants frequently have dark urine stains in their diapers. 2,8-dha is toxic to kidneys, which may explain the possible decline in kidney function and the progression to esrd."

what is (are) electrocardiogram ?,"an electrocardiogram (e-lek-tro-kar-de-o-gram), also called an ekg or ecg, is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. to understand this test, it helps to understand how the heart works.
                
with each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. as it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. the process repeats with each new heartbeat.
                
the heart's electrical signals set the rhythm of the heartbeat. for more detailed information and animations, go to the health topics how the heart works article.
                
an ekg shows:
                
how fast your heart is beating
                
whether the rhythm of your heartbeat is steady or irregular
                
the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart

what are the genetic changes related to osteogenesis imperfecta ?,"mutations in the col1a1, col1a2, crtap, and p3h1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta.  mutations in the col1a1 and col1a2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type i collagen. this type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body.  most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type i occur in the col1a1 gene. these genetic changes reduce the amount of type i collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily. the mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types ii, iii, and iv occur in either the col1a1 or col1a2 gene. these mutations typically alter the structure of type i collagen molecules. a defect in the structure of type i collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta.  mutations in the crtap and p3h1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. cases caused by crtap mutations are usually classified as type vii; when p3h1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type viii. the proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. these defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth.  in cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. these cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types v and vi. researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions."
what is (are) spondylocostal dysostosis 4 ?,"spondylocostal dysostosis is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of the bones in the spine and ribs. in the spine, the vertebrae are misshapen and fused. many people with this condition have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). the ribs may be fused together or missing. these bone malformations lead to short, rigid necks and short midsections. infants with spondylocostal dysostosis have small, narrow chests that cannot fully expand. this can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. males with this condition are at an increased risk for inguinal hernia, where the diaphragm is pushed down, causing the abdomen to bulge out. there are several types of spondylocostal dysostosis. these types have similar features and are distinguished by their genetic cause and how they are inherited.  spondylocostal dysostosis 4 is caused by mutations in the hes7 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include respiratory support and surgery to correct inguinal hernia and scoliosis."

what causes perineal injury in males ?,"chronic perineal injury most often results from a job-or sport-related practicesuch as bike, motorcycle, or horseback ridingor a long-term condition such as chronic constipation.
                
bike riding
                
sitting on a narrow, saddle-style bike seatwhich has a protruding nose in the frontplaces far more pressure on the perineum than sitting in a regular chair. in a regular chair, the flesh and bone of the buttocks partially absorb the pressure of sitting, and the pressure occurs farther toward the back than on a bike seat. the straddling position on a narrow seat pinches the perineal blood vessels and nerves, possibly causing blood vessel and nerve damage over time. research shows wider, noseless seats reduce perineal pressure.1
                
occasional bike riding for short periods of time may pose no risk. however, men who ride bikes several hours a weeksuch as competitive bicyclists, bicycle couriers, and bicycle patrol officershave a significantly higher risk of developing mild to severe ed.2 the ed may be caused by repetitive pressure on blood vessels, which constricts them and results in plaque buildup in the vessels.
                
other activities that involve riding saddle-style include motorcycle and horseback riding. researchers have studied bike riding more extensively than these other activities; however, the few studies published regarding motorcycle and horseback riding suggest motorcycle riding increases the risk of ed and urinary symptoms.3 horseback riding appears relatively safe in terms of chronic injury,4 although the action of bouncing up and down, repeatedly striking the perineum, has the potential for causing damage.
                
constipation
                
constipation is defined as having a bowel movement fewer than three times per week. people with constipation usually have hard, dry stools that are small in size and difficult to pass. some people with constipation need to strain to pass stools. this straining creates internal pressure that squeezes the perineum and can damage the perineal blood vessels and nerves. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, constipation."

is polycythemia vera inherited ?,"is polycythemia vera inherited? most cases of polycythemia vera (pcv) are not inherited from a parent and are acquired during a person's lifetime. the condition is associated with genetic changes (mutations) that are somatic, which means they occur in cells of the body but not in egg and sperm cells. in rare cases, the risk to develop pcv runs in families and sometimes appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. this means that only one altered copy of a gene in each cell is enough to give a person an increased risk for pcv. in other words, while an increased risk to develop pcv may be inherited, the condition itself is not inherited."
what is (are) primary sclerosing cholangitis ?,"psc is a disease that damages and blocks bile ducts inside and outside the liver. bile is a liquid made in the liver. bile ducts are tubes that carry bile out of the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. in the intestine, bile helps break down fat in food.
                
in psc, inflammation of the bile ducts leads to scar formation and narrowing of the ducts over time. as scarring increases, the ducts become blocked. as a result, bile builds up in the liver and damages liver cells. eventually, scar tissue can spread throughout the liver, causing cirrhosis and liver failure."
what is (are) knee replacement ?,"knee replacement is surgery for people with severe knee damage. knee replacement can relieve pain and allow you to be more active. your doctor may recommend it if you have knee pain and medicine and other treatments are not helping you anymore.    when you have a total knee replacement, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of your knee joint and replaces them with a man-made surface of metal and plastic. in a partial knee replacement, the surgeon only replaces one part of your knee joint. the surgery can cause scarring, blood clots, and, rarely, infections. after a knee replacement, you will no longer be able to do certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports."

what are the treatments for retroperitoneal fibrosis ?,"how might retroperitoneal fibrosis be treated? treatment of retroperitoneal fibrosis may include: corticosteroid therapy tamoxifen surgery stents corticosteroids are tried first. dosing will be prescribed on a case by case basis, but doses often vary between 30 and 60 mg per day. corticosteroids are then tapered slowly. some people with retroperitoneal fibrosis may continue on low dose maintenance therapy for up to 2 years. if corticosteroid treatment doesn't work, a biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. other medicines to suppress the immune system, such as mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide or tamoxifen can be prescribed alone or in combination with corticosteroids. when medicine does not work, surgery and stents (draining tubes) are considered. stents (drainage tubes) placed in the ureter or in the renal pelvis may provide short-term relief of the symptoms until the condition is surgically treated. surgery aims to remove the mass and/or free the ureters."
how to diagnose marburg hemorrhagic fever (marburg hf) ?,"many of the signs and symptoms of marburg hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of other more frequent infectious diseases, such as malaria or typhoid fever, making diagnosis of the disease difficult. this is especially true if only a single case is involved. 
 
however, if a person has the early symptoms of marburg hf and there is reason to believe that marburg hf should be considered, the patient should be isolated and public health professionals notified. samples from the patient can then be collected and tested to confirm infection. 
 
antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) testing, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and igm-capture elisa can be used to confirm a case of marburg hf within a few days of symptom onset. virus isolation may also be performed but should only be done in a high containment laboratory with good laboratory practices. the igg-capture elisa is appropriate for testing persons later in the course of disease or after recovery. in deceased patients, immunohistochemistry, virus isolation, or pcr of blood or tissue specimens may be used to diagnose marburg hf retrospectively."
what are the genetic changes related to rotor syndrome ?,"the slco1b1 and slco1b3 genes are involved in rotor syndrome. mutations in both genes are required for the condition to occur. the slco1b1 and slco1b3 genes provide instructions for making similar proteins, called organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b3 (oatp1b3), respectively. both proteins are found in liver cells; they transport bilirubin and other compounds from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. in the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body.  the slco1b1 and slco1b3 gene mutations that cause rotor syndrome lead to abnormally short, nonfunctional oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 proteins or an absence of these proteins. without the function of either transport protein, bilirubin is less efficiently taken up by the liver and removed from the body. the buildup of this substance leads to jaundice in people with rotor syndrome."
what are the symptoms of lactose intolerance ?,"common symptoms of lactose intolerance include
                
- abdominal bloating, a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen  - abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - gas  - nausea

what is (are) spinocerebellar ataxia 15 ?,"spinocerebellar ataxia 15 (sca15) is a neurological condition characterized by slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia, often in combination with eye movement abnormalities and  balance, speech and swallowing difficulties. the onset of symptoms typically occurs between ages 7 and 66 years. the ability to walk independently is often maintained for many years following onset of symptoms. sca15 is caused by mutations in the itpr1 gene. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, molecular genetic testing, and exclusion of other similar diseases. there is no effective treatment known to modify disease progression. patients may benefit from occupational and physical therapy for gait dysfunction and speech therapy for dysarthria."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for krabbe disease ?,"the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. the ninds is a component of the national institutes of health, the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world. hamatopoietic stem cell transplantation -- using stem cells from umbilical cord blood or bone marrow -- has been shown to benefit some individuals when given early in the course of the disease. scientists plan to test hematopoietic stem cell transplantation plus gene therapy to see if it dramatically increases life expectancy in a mouse model of the disease. also in a mouse mode, ninds-funded scientists are testing a combined treatment approach that uses a harmless virus to increase protein production, along with blood stem cell transplantation and small-molecule-based drugs, to reduce neuroinflammation, cell death, and nerve cell degeneration seen in krabbe disease."
what is (are) kidney failure: choosing a treatment that's right for you ?,"chronic kidney disease means you have damaged kidneys that cannot filter blood normally. wastes then build up in your blood, harming your body. kidney disease usually does not get better and may lead to kidney failure. if your kidneys fail, current treatment options can help you live a longer, healthier life. some people live with kidney disease for years without needing treatment. others progress quickly to kidney failure."
"what are the genetic changes related to 47,xyy syndrome ?","people normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. two of the 46 chromosomes, known as x and y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. females typically have two x chromosomes (46,xx), and males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome (46,xy).  47,xyy syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of the y chromosome in each of a male's cells. as a result of the extra y chromosome, each cell has a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. it is unclear why an extra copy of the y chromosome is associated with tall stature, learning problems, and other features in some boys and men.  some males with 47,xyy syndrome have an extra y chromosome in only some of their cells. this phenomenon is called 46,xy/47,xyy mosaicism."
what is (are) gaucher disease ?,"gaucher disease is one of the inherited metabolic disorders known as lipid storage diseases. lipids are fatty materials that include oils, fatty acids, waxes, and steroids (such as cholesterol and estrogen). gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. fatty materials can accumulate in the brain, spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and kidneys. symptoms may begin in early life or adulthood and include skeletal disorders and bone lesions that may cause pain and fractures, enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, anemia, and yellow spots in the eyes. there are three common clinical subtypes of gaucher disease. the first category, called type 1 (or nonneuropathic), typically does not affect the brain. symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood. people in this group usually bruise easily due to low blood platelets and experience fatigue due to anemia they also may have an enlarged liver and spleen. many individuals with a mild form of the disorder may not show any symptoms. in type 2 gaucher disease (acute infantile neuropathic gaucher disease), symptoms usually begin by 3 months of age and include extensive brain damage, seizures, spasticity, poor ability to suck and swallow, and enlarged liver and spleen. affecetd children usually die before 2 years of age. in the third category, called type 3 (or chronic neuropathic gaucher disease), signs of brain involvement such as seizures gradually become apparent. major symptoms also include skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, cognitive deficit, poor coordination, enlarged liver and spleen, respiratory problems, and blood disorders."
what is (are) alcohol use and older adults ?,"alcohol, also known as ethanol, is a chemical found in beverages like beer, wine, and distilled spirits such as whiskey, vodka, and rum. through a process called fermentation, yeast converts the sugars naturally found in grains and grapes into the alcohol that is in beer and wine. another process, called distillation, concentrates alcohol in the drink making it stronger, producing what are known as distilled spirits."
what causes tourette syndrome ?,"what causes tourette syndrome? although the cause of tourette syndrome is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions (including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex), the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) responsible for communication among nerve cells. given the often complex presentation of tourette syndrome, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex. in many cases, there is a family history of tics, tourette syndrome, adhd, ocd. in 2005, scientists discovered the first gene mutation that may cause some cases of tourette syndrome. this gene, named slitrk1, is normally involved with the growth of nerve cells and how they connect with other neurons.  the mutated gene is located in regions of the brain (basal ganglia, cortex, and frontal lobes) previously identified as being associated with tourette syndrome."
is factor xiii deficiency inherited ?,"inherited factor xiii deficiency is considered to have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means that it results when both copies of either the f13a1 gene or the f13b gene in each cell have mutations.  some people, including parents of individuals with factor xiii deficiency, carry a single mutated copy of the f13a1 or f13b gene in each cell. these mutation carriers have a reduced amount of factor xiii in their bloodstream (20 to 60 percent of normal), and they may experience abnormal bleeding after surgery, dental work, or major trauma. however, most people who carry one mutated copy of the f13a1 or f13b gene do not have abnormal bleeding episodes under normal circumstances, and so they never come to medical attention.  the acquired form of factor xiii deficiency is not inherited and does not run in families."
is neuroferritinopathy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
is cyclic neutropenia inherited ?,"cyclic neutropenia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
what are the symptoms of inclusion body myopathy 2 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of inclusion body myopathy 2? inclusion body myopathy 2 causes muscle weakness that appears in late adolescence or early adulthood and worsens over time.the first sign of inclusion body myopathy 2 is often weakness of  the tibialis anterior, a muscle in the lower leg that helps control up-and-down movement of the foot. weakness in the tibialis anterior alters the way a person walks and makes it difficult to run and climb stairs. as the disorder progresses, weakness also develops in muscles of the upper legs, hips, shoulders, and hands. unlike most forms of myopathy, inclusion body myopathy 2 usually does not affect the quadriceps (a group of large muscles at the front of the thigh). this condition also spares muscles of the eye or heart, and does not cause neurological problems. weakness in leg muscles makes walking increasingly difficult, and most people with inclusion body myopathy 2 require wheelchair assistance within 20 years after signs and symptoms appear. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for inclusion body myopathy 2. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) adult onset - autosomal recessive inheritance - deposits immunoreactive to beta-amyloid protein - distal amyotrophy - distal muscle weakness - elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - emg: myopathic abnormalities - gait disturbance - limb-girdle muscle atrophy - limb-girdle muscle weakness - proximal muscle weakness - rimmed vacuoles - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
how to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism ?,"health care providers diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism when a person has high blood calcium and pth levels. high blood calcium is usually the first sign that leads health care providers to suspect parathyroid gland overactivity. other diseases can cause high blood calcium levels, but only in primary hyperparathyroidism is the elevated calcium the result of too much pth.
                
routine blood tests that screen for a wide range of conditions, including high blood calcium levels, are helping health care providers diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism in people who have mild forms of the disorder and are symptom-free. for a blood test, blood is drawn at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis."
what are the treatments for fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia ?,"how might fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (nait) be treated? nait is often unexpected and is usually diagnosed after birth. once suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of maternal anti-platelet antibodies directed against a paternal antigen inherited by the baby. management in the newborn period involves transfusion of platelets that do not contain the specific antigens. prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce the chances of death and disability due to severe bleeding."

what are the genetic changes related to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita ?,"spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the col2a1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type ii collagen. this type of collagen is found mostly in cartilage and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous). the col2a1 gene is essential for the normal development of bones and other tissues that form the body's supportive framework (connective tissues). mutations in the col2a1 gene interfere with the assembly of type ii collagen molecules, which prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly."
is simpson-golabi-behmel syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. because females have two copies of the x chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males, or it may cause no symptoms at all.  some females who have one altered copy of the gpc3 gene have distinctive facial features including an upturned nose, a wide mouth, and a prominent chin. their fingernails may be malformed and they can have extra nipples. skeletal abnormalities, including extra spinal bones (vertebrae), are also possible in affected females. other females who carry one altered copy of the gpc3 gene do not have these features or any other medical problems associated with simpson-golabi-behmel syndrome."

what are the treatments for mitochondrial complex iv deficiency ?,"how might cytochrome c oxidase deficiency be treated? there is currently no cure for cytochrome c oxidase (cox) deficiency. management of all forms of cox deficiency generally focuses on the specific symptoms present in the affected individual and is largely supportive. the goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and slow progression of the disease; the effectiveness of treatment varies with each individual. treatment generally does not reverse any damage that has already occurred. prognosis varies depending on the form of cox deficiency present. individuals with benign infantile mitochondrial myopathy may experience spontaneous recovery (although early diagnosis and intensive treatment is still needed until this point), while there may be rapid demise in individuals with leigh syndrome. it is often recommended that individuals with mitochondrial disorders such as cox deficiency avoid fasting. dehydration due to vomiting or illness may be treated with intravenous fluid if the individual is not able to take fluids orally. seizures are typically controlled with anticonvulsants. some affected individuals may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapies that are specifically tailored to their needs. dietary supplements including certain vitamins and cofactors have shown varying degrees of benefit in individual cases. individuals interested in specific management recommendations for themselves or relatives should speak with their healthcare providers."

                    gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) is a group of rare diseases in which abnormal trophoblast cells grow inside the uterus after conception.
                    in gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd), a tumor develops inside the uterus from tissue that forms after conception (the joining of sperm and egg). this tissue is made of trophoblast cells and normally surrounds the fertilized egg in the uterus. trophoblast cells help connect the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus and form part of the placenta (the organ that passes nutrients from the mother to the fetus).   sometimes there is a problem with the fertilized egg and trophoblast cells. instead of a healthy fetus developing, a tumor forms. until there are signs or symptoms of the tumor, the pregnancy will seem like a normal pregnancy.   most gtd is benign (not cancer) and does not spread, but some types become malignant (cancer) and spread to nearby tissues or distant parts of the body.   gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) is a general term that includes different types of disease:         -  hydatidiform moles (hm)               - complete hm.      - partial hm.             - gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn)               -  invasive moles.      -  choriocarcinomas.      - placental-site trophoblastic tumors (pstt; very rare).      - epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ett; even more rare).
                
                
                    hydatidiform mole (hm) is the most common type of gtd.
                    hms are slow-growing tumors that look like sacs of fluid. an hm is also called a molar pregnancy. the cause of hydatidiform moles is not known.   hms may be complete or partial:         - a complete hm forms when sperm fertilizes an egg that does not contain the mothers dna. the egg has dna from the father and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.    - a partial hm forms when sperm fertilizes a normal egg and there are two sets of dna from the father in the fertilized egg. only part of the fetus forms and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.        most hydatidiform moles are benign, but they sometimes become cancer. having one or more of the following risk factors increases the risk that a hydatidiform mole will become cancer:         - a pregnancy before 20 or after 35 years of age.    - a very high level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg), a hormone made by the body during pregnancy.    - a large tumor in the uterus.     - an ovarian cyst larger than 6 centimeters.     -  high blood pressure during pregnancy.    - an overactive thyroid gland (extra thyroid hormone is made).    - severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.    - trophoblastic cells in the blood, which may block small blood vessels.     - serious blood clotting problems caused by the hm.
                
                
                    gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd) that is almost always malignant.
                    gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (gtn) includes the following:     invasive moles    invasive moles are made up of trophoblast cells that grow into the muscle layer of the uterus. invasive moles are more likely to grow and spread than a hydatidiform mole. rarely, a complete or partial hm may become an invasive mole. sometimes an invasive mole will disappear without treatment.       choriocarcinomas    a choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that forms from trophoblast cells and spreads to the muscle layer of the uterus and nearby blood vessels. it may also spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, intestines, pelvis, or vagina. a choriocarcinoma is more likely to form in women who have had any of the following:            -  molar pregnancy, especially with a complete hydatidiform mole.      - normal pregnancy.     - tubal pregnancy (the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus).     - miscarriage.              placental-site trophoblastic tumors    a placental-site trophoblastic tumor (pstt) is a rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that forms where the placenta attaches to the uterus. the tumor forms from trophoblast cells and spreads into the muscle of the uterus and into blood vessels. it may also spread to the lungs, pelvis, or lymph nodes. a pstt grows very slowly and signs or symptoms may appear months or years after a normal pregnancy.        epithelioid trophoblastic tumors    an epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ett) is a very rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that may be benign or malignant. when the tumor is malignant, it may spread to the lungs."

                    after small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. some of the tests used to diagnose small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (see the general information section.)    other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:         -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain: a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain, chest or upper abdomen, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. a pet scan and ct scan may be done at the same time. this is called a pet-ct.    -   bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. the disease is metastatic small cell lung cancer, not brain cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for small cell lung cancer:
                    limited-stage small cell lung cancer    in limited-stage, cancer is in the lung where it started and may have spread to the area between the lungs or to the lymph nodes above the collarbone.        extensive-stage small cell lung cancer    in extensive-stage, cancer has spread beyond the lung or the area between the lungs or the lymph nodes above the collarbone to other places in the body."

what are the genetic changes related to huntington disease ?,"mutations in the htt gene cause huntington disease. the htt gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. although the function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.  the htt mutation that causes huntington disease involves a dna segment known as a cag trinucleotide repeat. this segment is made up of a series of three dna building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. normally, the cag segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene. in people with huntington disease, the cag segment is repeated 36 to more than 120 times. people with 36 to 39 cag repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of huntington disease, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.  an increase in the size of the cag segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. the elongated protein is cut into smaller, toxic fragments that bind together and accumulate in neurons, disrupting the normal functions of these cells. the dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of huntington disease."

is epidermolysis bullosa inherited ?,"how is epidermolysis bullosa inherited? inherited epidermolysis bullosa (eb) may follow either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, depending on the type and subtype of inherited eb in the affected person. epidermolysis bullosa simplex (the most common type of eb) is mainly autosomal dominant, except for a few rare autosomal recessive subtypes. dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (deb) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, depending on the subtype present. however, dominant deb is the second most common major type of eb. junctional epidermolysis bullosa is autosomal recessive, although one article stated that an autosomal dominant form has recently been reported. kindler syndrome is only inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. a condition is autosomal dominant if having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. when a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from the affected parent. many people with an autosomal dominant form of eb have an affected parent, but in some cases a mutation in the responsible gene occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of eb (called a de novo mutation). a person with a de novo mutation still has a 50% chance to pass the mutation on to each of his/her children. in autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. typically, an affected person inherits one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene from each parent, who are referred to as carriers. carriers usually do not have symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not be a carrier and not be affected. epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (acquired eb) is a rare autoimmune disorder and is not inherited."

what are the symptoms of creutzfeldt-jakob disease ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of creutzfeldt-jakob disease? creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia. initially, patients experience problems with muscular coordination; personality changes, including impaired memory, judgment, and thinking; and impaired vision. people with the disease also may experience insomnia, depression, or unusual sensations. cjd does not cause a fever or other flu-like symptoms. as the illness progresses, the patients mental impairment becomes severe. they often develop involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus, and they may go blind. they eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma. pneumonia and other infections often occur in these patients and can lead to death. there are several known variants of cjd. these variants differ somewhat in the symptoms and course of the disease. for example, a variant form of the disease-called new variant or variant (nv-cjd, v-cjd), described in great britain and france-begins primarily with psychiatric symptoms, affects younger patients than other types of cjd, and has a longer than usual duration from onset of symptoms to death. another variant, called the panencephalopathic form, occurs primarily in japan and has a relatively long course, with symptoms often progressing for several years. scientists are trying to learn what causes these variations in the symptoms and course of the disease. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for creutzfeldt-jakob disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) increased csf protein 5% anxiety - apathy - aphasia - autosomal dominant inheritance - confusion - delusions - dementia - depression - extrapyramidal muscular rigidity - gait ataxia - hallucinations - hemiparesis - irritability - loss of facial expression - memory impairment - myoclonus - personality changes - rapidly progressive - supranuclear gaze palsy - visual impairment - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) urinary incontinence ?,"urinary incontinence (ui) is loss of bladder control. symptoms can range from mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. it can happen to anyone, but it becomes more common with age. women experience ui twice as often as men.    most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. if the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak, you may have accidents when you sneeze, laugh or lift a heavy object. this is stress incontinence. if bladder muscles become too active, you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. this is urge incontinence or overactive bladder. there are other causes of incontinence, such as prostate problems and nerve damage.    treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle. it may include simple exercises, medicines, special devices or procedures prescribed by your doctor, or surgery.     nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"

how many people are affected by renal tubular acidosis with deafness ?,renal tubular acidosis with deafness is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
who is at risk for chapare hemorrhagic fever (chhf)? ?,"like all arenaviruses, chapare virus has a rodent host as its reservoir. humans can contract chhf through contact with an infected rodent. contact can be direct or through inhalation of aerosolized chapare virus from the urine or feces of infected rodents. 
 
although arenaviruses have been isolated from insects, neither they nor any other intermediary host appear to spread chhf. 
 
person-to-person transmission of arenaviruses through aerosolization, although possible, is rare. from the only observed cluster of cases of chhf, there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission. 
 
transmission, if it can occur with chhf, is most likely the result of direct contact with an infected person."
is porphyria inherited ?,"some types of porphyria are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the gene in each cell is mutated. this single mutation is sufficient to reduce the activity of an enzyme needed for heme production, which increases the risk of developing signs and symptoms of porphyria. autosomal dominant porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria, most cases of erythropoietic protoporphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. although the gene mutations associated with some cases of porphyria cutanea tarda also have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, most people with this form of porphyria do not have an inherited gene mutation.  other porphyrias are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. porphyrias with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance include alad deficiency porphyria, congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and some cases of erythropoietic protoporphyria.  when erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by mutations in the alas2 gene, it has an x-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. the alas2 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may be sufficient to cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. males may experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  mutations in the urod gene are related to both porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. individuals who inherit one altered copy of the urod gene are at increased risk for porphyria cutanea tarda. (multiple genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to this condition.) people who inherit two altered copies of the urod gene in each cell develop hepatoerythropoietic porphyria."
what are the treatments for lesch-nyhan syndrome ?,"treatment for lns is symptomatic. gout can be treated with allopurinol to control excessive amounts of uric acid. kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. there is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of lns. some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital hyperinsulinism ?,"congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that regulate the release (secretion) of insulin, which is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. insulin clears excess sugar (in the form of glucose) from the bloodstream by passing glucose into cells to be used as energy.  gene mutations that cause congenital hyperinsulinism lead to over-secretion of insulin from beta cells. normally, insulin is secreted in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream: when glucose levels rise, so does insulin secretion. however, in people with congenital hyperinsulinism, insulin is secreted from beta cells regardless of the amount of glucose present in the blood. this excessive secretion of insulin results in glucose being rapidly removed from the bloodstream and passed into tissues such as muscle, liver, and fat. a lack of glucose in the blood results in frequent states of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism. insufficient blood glucose also deprives the brain of its primary source of fuel.  mutations in at least nine genes have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. mutations in the abcc8 gene are the most common known cause of the disorder. they account for this condition in approximately 40 percent of affected individuals. less frequently, mutations in the kcnj11 gene have been found in people with congenital hyperinsulinism. mutations in each of the other genes associated with this condition account for only a small percentage of cases.  in approximately half of people with congenital hyperinsulinism, the cause is unknown."
what causes cushing's syndrome ?,"cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. many people develop cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue.
                
other people develop cushing's syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. first, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) to the pituitary gland. crh causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (acth), which stimulates the adrenal glands. when the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the acth, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.
                
cortisol performs vital tasks in the body including
                
- helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function  - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response  - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy  - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats
                
one of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. for this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. people suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.
                
when the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less crh and acth. this process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. however, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.
                
pituitary adenomas
                
pituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. these benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra acth. most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. this form of the syndrome, known as cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men.
                
ectopic acth syndrome
                
some benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce acth. this condition is known as ectopic acth syndrome. lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women. the most common forms of acth-producing tumors are small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 13 percent of all lung cancer cases,2 and carcinoid tumors-small, slow-growing tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in various parts of the body. other less common types of tumors that can produce acth are thymomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.
                
adrenal tumors
                
in rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes cushing's syndrome. adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood.
                
adrenocortical carcinomas-adrenal cancers-are the least common cause of cushing's syndrome. with adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.
                
familial cushing's syndrome
                
most cases of cushing's syndrome are not inherited. rarely, however, cushing's syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. with primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; cushing's syndrome in men1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors."
what is (are) dandy-walker syndrome ?,"dandy-walker syndrome is a congenital brain malformation involving the cerebellum (an area of the back of the brain that coordinates movement) and the fluid-filled spaces around it. the key features of this syndrome are an enlargement of the fourth ventricle (a small channel that allows fluid to flow freely between the upper and lower areas of the brain and spinal cord), a partial or complete absence of the area of the brain between the two cerebellar hemispheres (cerebellar vermis), and cyst formation near the lowest part of the skull. an increase in the size and pressure of the fluid spaces surrounding the brain (hydrocephalus) may also be present. the syndrome can appear dramatically or develop unnoticed. symptoms, which often occur in early infancy, include slow motor development and progressive enlargement of the skull. in older children, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull) such as irritability and vomiting, and signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as unsteadiness, lack of muscle coordination, or jerky movements of the eyes may occur. other symptoms include increased head circumference, bulging at the back of the skull, abnormal breathing problems, and problems with the nerves that control the eyes, face and neck. dandy-walker syndrome is sometimes associated with disorders of other areas of the central nervous system, including absence of the area made up of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres (corpus callosum) and malformations of the heart, face, limbs, fingers and toes."

researchers are continuing to study dbs and to develop ways of improving it. a two-part study funded by the ninds and the department of veterans affairs first compared bilateral dbs to best medical therapy, including medication adjustment and physical therapy. bilateral dbs showed overall superiority to best medical therapy at improving motor symptoms and quality of life. the second part of the study, involving nearly 300 patients, compared subthalamic nucleus (stn) dbs to globus pallidus interna (gpi) dbs. the two groups reported similar improvements in motor control and quality of life in scores on the unified parkinsons disease rating scale. on a variety of neuropsychological tests, there were no significant differences between the two groups. however, the stn dbs group experienced a greater decline on a test of visuomotor processing speed, which measures how quickly someone thinks and acts on information. also, the stn dbs group had slight worsening on a standard assessment of depression, while the gpi dbs group had slight improvement on the same test. the importance of these two differences is not clear, and will be scrutinized in follow-up research.
                
in addition, ninds-supported researchers are developing and testing improved implantable pulse generators, and conducting studies to better understand the therapeutic effect of neurostimulation on neural circuitry and brain regions affected in pd. for more information about current studies on brain stimulation and parkinsons disease, see www.clinicaltrials.gov and search for deep brain stimulation and parkinson and ninds. for information about ninds-and nih-supported research studies in this area, see the nih reporter (research portfolio online reporting tools) at http://projectreporter.nih.gov and search for deep brain stimulation and parkinson.
                
the brain initiative for advancing innovative neurotechnologies (brain) initiative, announced in 2013, offers unprecedented opportunities to unlock the mysteries of the brain and accelerate the development of research and technologies to treat disorders such as parkinsons disease. for more information about the brain initiative, see www.nih.gov/science/brain."

who is at risk for what i need to know about my child's urinary tract infection? ?,"any child can get a uti, though girls get utis more often than boys.
                
children with a condition called vesicoureteral reflux (vur) are at higher risk for utis. vur causes urine to reflux at the point where one or both ureters attach to the bladder. when urine stays in the urinary tract, bacteria have a chance to grow and spread. infants and young children who get a uti often have vur.
                
boys younger than 6 months who are not circumcised are at greater risk for a uti than circumcised boys the same age. boys who are circumcised have had the foreskin, which is the skin that covers the tip of the penis, removed."

who is at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome? ?,"people who are obese are at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ohs). ""obesity"" refers to having too much body fat. people who are obese have body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.
                
the most useful measure of obesity is body mass index (bmi). bmi is calculated from your height and weight. in adults, a bmi of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
you can use the national heart, lung, and blood institute's (nhlbi's) online bmi calculator to figure out your bmi, or your doctor can help you.
                
if you are obese, you're at greater risk for ohs if your bmi is 40 or higher. you're also at greater risk if most of your excess weight is around your waist, rather than at your hips. this is referred to as ""abdominal obesity.""

is leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited ?,"how is leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited? leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."
what are the genetic changes related to cystic fibrosis ?,"mutations in the cftr gene cause cystic fibrosis. the cftr gene provides instructions for making a channel that transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. chloride is a component of sodium chloride, a common salt found in sweat. chloride also has important functions in cells; for example, the flow of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus.  mutations in the cftr gene disrupt the function of the chloride channels, preventing them from regulating the flow of chloride ions and water across cell membranes. as a result, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce mucus that is unusually thick and sticky. this mucus clogs the airways and various ducts, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  other genetic and environmental factors likely influence the severity of the condition. for example, mutations in genes other than cftr might help explain why some people with cystic fibrosis are more severely affected than others. most of these genetic changes have not been identified, however."

what is (are) familial glucocorticoid deficiency ?,"familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. these hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.  a shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. these signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. most affected children first develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). these hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). if left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation).  there are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are distinguished by their genetic cause."
what are the genetic changes related to fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy ?,"fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the fktn gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called fukutin. although the exact function of fukutin is unclear, researchers predict that it may chemically modify a protein called alpha ()-dystroglycan. this protein anchors cells to the lattice of proteins and other molecules (the extracellular matrix) that surrounds them. in skeletal muscles, -dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. in the brain, this protein helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.  the most common mutation in the fktn gene reduces the amount of fukutin produced within cells. a shortage of fukutin likely prevents the normal modification of -dystroglycan, which disrupts that protein's normal function. without functional -dystroglycan to stabilize muscle cells, muscle fibers become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. the damaged fibers weaken and die over time, leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles.  defective -dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes cobblestone lissencephaly in children with fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. less is known about the effects of fktn mutations in other parts of the body.  because fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy involves a malfunction of -dystroglycan, this condition is described as a dystroglycanopathy."

what is (are) juvenile paget disease ?,"juvenile paget disease is a disorder that affects bone growth. this disease causes bones to be abnormally large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured).  the signs of juvenile paget disease appear in infancy or early childhood. as bones grow, they become progressively weaker and more deformed. these abnormalities usually become more severe during the adolescent growth spurt, when bones grow very quickly.  juvenile paget disease affects the entire skeleton, resulting in widespread bone and joint pain. the bones of the skull tend to grow unusually large and thick, which can lead to hearing loss. the disease also affects bones of the spine (vertebrae). the deformed vertebrae can collapse, leading to abnormal curvature of the spine. additionally, weight-bearing long bones in the legs tend to bow and fracture easily, which can interfere with standing and walking."
what are the genetic changes related to ataxia neuropathy spectrum ?,"ataxia neuropathy spectrum is caused by mutations in the polg gene or, rarely, the c10orf2 gene.  the polg gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol ). the c10orf2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called twinkle. pol  and twinkle function in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. mitochondria each contain a small amount of dna, known as mitochondrial dna (mtdna), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. pol  and twinkle are both integral to the process of dna replication by which new copies of mtdna are produced.  mutated pol  or mutated twinkle reduce mtdna replication. although the mechanisms are unknown, mutations in the polg gene often result in fewer copies of mtdna (mtdna depletion), and mutations in the c10orf2 gene often result in deletions of large regions of mtdna (mtdna deletion). mtdna depletion or deletion occurs most commonly in muscle, brain, or liver cells. mtdna depletion causes a decrease in cellular energy, which could account for the signs and symptoms of ataxia neuropathy spectrum. it is unclear what role mtdna deletions play in the signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to wolf-hirschhorn syndrome ?,"wolf-hirschhorn syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 4. this chromosomal change is sometimes written as 4p-. the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions.  the signs and symptoms of wolf-hirschhorn are related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 4. whsc1, letm1, and msx1 are the genes that are deleted in people with the typical signs and symptoms of this disorder. these genes play significant roles in early development, although many of their specific functions are unknown. researchers believe that loss of the whsc1 gene is associated with many of the characteristic features of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome, including the distinctive facial appearance and developmental delay. deletion of the letm1 gene appears to be associated with seizures or other abnormal electrical activity in the brain. a loss of the msx1 gene may be responsible for the dental abnormalities and cleft lip and/or palate that are often seen with this condition.  scientists are working to identify additional genes at the end of the short arm of chromosome 4 that contribute to the characteristic features of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome."

what is (are) neuroblastoma ?,"key points
                    - neuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in nerve tissue.    - most cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed before 1 year of age.     - the risk factors for neuroblastoma are not known.
                
                
                    neuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in nerve tissue.
                    neuroblastoma often begins in the nerve tissue of the adrenal glands. there are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney, in the back of the upper abdomen. the adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. neuroblastoma may also begin in the abdomen, chest, spinal cord, or in nerve tissue near the spine in the neck.    neuroblastoma most often begins during early childhood, usually in children younger than 5 years of age.   see the pdq summary on neuroblastoma treatment for more information about neuroblastoma.
                
                
                    most cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed before 1 year of age.
                    neuroblastoma is the most common type of cancer in infants. the number of new cases of neuroblastoma is greatest among children under 1 year of age. as children get older, the number of new cases decreases. neuroblastoma is slightly more common in males than females.    neuroblastoma sometimes forms before birth but is usually found later, when the tumor begins to grow and cause symptoms. in rare cases, neuroblastoma may be found before birth, by fetal ultrasound."
what are the treatments for neonatal progeroid syndrome ?,"how might neonatal progeroid syndrome be treated? because neonatal progeroid syndrome affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. for example, a feeding tube may be recommended in infants with feeding difficulties who have trouble putting on weight."
what are the genetic changes related to sjgren-larsson syndrome ?,"mutations in the aldh3a2 gene cause sjgren-larsson syndrome. the aldh3a2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (faldh). the faldh enzyme is part of a multistep process called fatty acid oxidation in which fats are broken down and converted into energy. specifically, the faldh enzyme breaks down molecules called fatty aldehydes to fatty acids.  aldh3a2 gene mutations disrupt the normal process of fatty acid oxidation. most mutations result in the production of a faldh enzyme that is unable to break down fatty aldehyde molecules. as a result, fats that cannot be broken down build up in cells. within skin cells, excess fat accumulation can interfere with the formation of membranes that act as protective barriers to control water loss. as a result of the loss of these protective barriers, the skin has difficulty maintaining its water balance, resulting in dry, scaly skin. in the brain, the consequences of excess fat accumulation are unclear, but it is likely that an abundance of fat disrupts the formation of myelin. myelin is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. a lack of myelin can lead to neurological problems such as intellectual disability and walking difficulties. the cause of the eye problems is unclear, but it is also likely related to a disruption in the breakdown of fats."
how many people are affected by corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency ?,"the prevalence of corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency is unknown, but it is thought to be a rare disorder. however, because some people with the disorder have mild or no symptoms, it is likely that corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency is underdiagnosed."

what is (are) hypokalemic periodic paralysis ?,"hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness typically beginning in childhood or adolescence. most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. attacks cause severe weakness or paralysis that usually lasts from hours to days. some people may have episodes almost every day, while others experience them weekly, monthly, or only rarely. attacks can occur without warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral illness, or certain medications. often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal or vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following morning. although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength between attacks, repeated episodes can lead to persistent muscle weakness later in life.  people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis have reduced levels of potassium in their blood (hypokalemia) during episodes of muscle weakness. researchers are investigating how low potassium levels may be related to the muscle abnormalities in this condition."
is fibronectin glomerulopathy inherited ?,"when fibronectin glomerulopathy is caused by mutations in the fn1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. some people who have the altered fn1 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance."
what are the genetic changes related to sost-related sclerosing bone dysplasia ?,"sost-related sclerosing bone dysplasia is caused by mutations in or near the sost gene. the sost gene provides instructions for making the protein sclerostin. sclerostin is produced in osteocytes, which are a type of bone cell. the main function of sclerostin is to stop (inhibit) bone formation.  mutations in the sost gene that cause sclerosteosis prevent the production of any functional sclerostin. a lack of sclerostin disrupts the inhibitory role it plays during bone formation, causing excessive bone growth.  sost mutations that cause van buchem disease result in a shortage of functional sclerostin. this shortage reduces the protein's ability to inhibit bone formation, causing the excessive bone growth seen in people with van buchem disease."
is prolidase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

how to diagnose von willebrand disease ?,"early diagnosis of von willebrand disease (vwd) is important to make sure that you're treated and can live a normal, active life.
                
sometimes vwd is hard to diagnose. people who have type 1 or type 2 vwd may not have major bleeding problems. thus, they may not be diagnosed unless they have heavy bleeding after surgery or some other trauma.
                
on the other hand, type 3 vwd can cause major bleeding problems during infancy and childhood. so, children who have type 3 vwd usually are diagnosed during their first year of life.
                
to find out whether you have vwd, your doctor will review your medical history and the results from a physical exam and tests.
                
medical history
                
your doctor will likely ask questions about your medical history and your family's medical history. he or she may ask about:
                
any bleeding from a small wound that lasted more than 15 minutes or started up again within the first 7 days following the injury.
                
any prolonged, heavy, or repeated bleeding that required medical care after surgery or dental extractions.
                
any bruising with little or no apparent trauma, especially if you could feel a lump under the bruise.
                
any nosebleeds that occurred for no known reason and lasted more than 10 minutes despite pressure on the nose, or any nosebleeds that needed medical attention.
                
any blood in your stools for no known reason.
                
any heavy menstrual bleeding (for women). this bleeding usually involves clots or lasts longer than 7 to 10 days.
                
any history of muscle or joint bleeding.
                
any medicines you've taken that might cause bleeding or increase the risk of bleeding. examples include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), clopidogrel, warfarin, or heparin.
                
any history of liver or kidney disease, blood or bone marrow disease, or high or low blood platelet counts.
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to look for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding. he or she also will look for signs of liver disease or anemia (a low red blood cell count).
                
diagnostic tests
                
no single test can diagnose vwd. your doctor may recommend one or more blood tests to diagnose the disorder. these tests may include:
                
von willebrand factor antigen. this test measures the amount of von willebrand factor in your blood.
                
von willebrand factor ristocetin (ris-to-see-tin) cofactor activity. this test shows how well your von willebrand factor works.
                
factor viii clotting activity. this test checks the clotting activity of factor viii. some people who have vwd have low levels of factor viii activity, while others have normal levels.
                
von willebrand factor multimers. this test is done if one or more of the first three tests are abnormal. it shows the structure of your von willebrand factor. the test helps your doctor diagnose what type of vwd you have.
                
platelet function test. this test measures how well your platelets are working.
                
you may have these tests more than once to confirm a diagnosis. your doctor also may refer you to a hematologist to confirm the diagnosis and for followup care. a hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders."
"what is (are) polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome ?","polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (pmse syndrome) is characterized by excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the uterus during pregnancy (polyhydramnios), abnormally large, heavy, and usually malfunctioning brain (megalencephaly), seizures and intellectual disability. some patients also have heart problems, diabetes insipidus, kidney problems and leukemia. it is caused by a mutation in the lyk5 gene.  seizures are difficult to treat and there is ongoing research for more effective medication."
what is (are) congenital dyserythropoietic anemia ?,"congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (cda) is an inherited blood disorder that affects the development of red blood cells. this disorder is one of many types of anemia, which is a condition characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. this shortage prevents the blood from carrying an adequate supply of oxygen to the body's tissues. the resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and other complications.  researchers have identified three major types of cda: type i, type ii, and type iii. the types have different genetic causes and different but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms.  cda type i is characterized by moderate to severe anemia. it is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can be detected before birth. many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). this condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. in particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). rarely, people with cda type i are born with skeletal abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes.  the anemia associated with cda type ii can range from mild to severe, and most affected individuals have jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and the formation of hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones. this form of the disorder is usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. an abnormal buildup of iron typically occurs after age 20, leading to complications including heart disease, diabetes, and cirrhosis.  the signs and symptoms of cda type iii tend to be milder than those of the other types. most affected individuals do not have hepatosplenomegaly, and iron does not build up in tissues and organs. in adulthood, abnormalities of a specialized tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) can cause vision impairment. some people with cda type iii also have a blood disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy, which can lead to a cancer of white blood cells (multiple myeloma).  several other variants of cda have been described, although they appear to be rare and not much is known about them. once researchers discover the genetic causes of these variants, some of them may be grouped with the three major types of cda."
what are the treatments for what i need to know about hepatitis b ?,"hepatitis b is not usually treated unless it becomes chronic. chronic hepatitis b is treated with medicines that slow or stop the virus from damaging the liver.
                
medicines for chronic hepatitis b
                
your doctor will choose medicines or a combination of medicines that are likely to work for you. the doctor will closely watch your symptoms and schedule regular blood tests to make sure treatment is working.
                
medicines given by shots include
                
- interferon  - peginterferon
                
medicines taken by mouth include
                
- adefovir  - entecavir  - lamivudine  - telbivudine  - tenofovir
                
the length of treatment varies. talk with your doctor before taking other prescription medicines and over-the-counter medicines.
                
liver transplant
                
a liver transplant may be necessary if chronic hepatitis b causes severe liver damage that leads to liver failure. symptoms of severe liver damage include the symptoms of hepatitis b and
                
- generalized itching  - a longer than usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - swollen stomach or ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin
                
liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. if your doctors tell you that you need a transplant, you should talk with them about the long-term demands of living with a liver transplant.
                
a team of surgeonsdoctors who specialize in surgeryperforms a liver transplant in a hospital. you will learn how to take care of yourself after you go home and about the medicines youll need to take to protect your new liver. medicines taken after liver transplant surgery can prevent hepatitis b from coming back.
                
testing for liver cancer
                
having hepatitis b increases your risk for getting liver cancer, so your doctor may suggest an ultrasound test of the liver every 6 to 12 months. finding cancer early makes it more treatable. ultrasound is a machine that uses sound waves to create a picture of your liver. ultrasound is performed at a hospital or radiology center by a specially trained technician. the image, called a sonogram, can show the livers size and the presence of cancerous tumors."

what to do for wilson disease ?,"- wilson disease is a genetic disease that prevents the body from removing extra copper.  - normally, the liver filters extra copper and releases it into bile. in wilson disease, the liver does not filter copper correctly and copper builds up in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs.  - wilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the atp7b gene. in an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease.  - the signs and symptoms of wilson disease vary, depending on what organs of the body are affected. people with wilson disease may have      - liver-related signs and symptoms    - central nervous system-related signs and symptoms    - mental health-related signs and symptoms    - other signs and symptoms    - a health care provider will treat wilson disease with a lifelong effort to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. treatment may include      - medications    - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition    - a liver transplant    - people with wilson disease should reduce their dietary copper intake by avoiding foods that are high in copper, such as      - shellfish    - liver    - mushrooms    - nuts    - chocolate    - a person cannot prevent wilson disease; however, people with a family history of wilson disease, especially those with an affected sibling or parent, should talk with a health care provider about testing."
what are the symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis? chorea-acanthocytosis affects movement in many parts of the body. chorea refers to the involuntary jerking movements made by people with this disorder. people with this condition also have abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis). another common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis is involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), such as those in the limbs, face, mouth, tongue, and throat. these muscle twitches can cause vocal tics (such as grunting), involuntary belching, and limb spasms. eating can also be impaired as tongue and throat twitches can interfere with chewing and swallowing food. people with chorea-acanthocytosis may uncontrollably bite their tongue, lips, and inside of the mouth. nearly half of all people with chorea-acanthocytosis have seizures. individuals with chorea-acanthocytosis may develop difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). they may also have reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) and muscle weakness (myopathy). impaired muscle and nerve functioning commonly cause speech difficulties, and can lead to an inability to speak. behavioral changes are also a common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis and may be the first sign of this condition. these behavioral changes may include changes in personality, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), lack of self-restraint, and the inability to take care of oneself. the signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis usually begin in early to mid-adulthood. the movement problems of this condition worsen with age. loss of cells (atrophy) in certain brain regions is the major cause of the neurological problems seen in people with chorea-acanthocytosis. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for chorea-acanthocytosis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of erythrocytes 90% incoordination 90% muscular hypotonia 90% neurological speech impairment 90% pallor 90% peripheral neuropathy 90% abnormality of coagulation 50% abnormality of the oral cavity 50% abnormality of urine homeostasis 50% attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 50% cerebral cortical atrophy 50% chorea 50% developmental regression 50% emg abnormality 50% gait disturbance 50% memory impairment 50% myopathy 50% seizures 50% skeletal muscle atrophy 50% tremor 50% ventriculomegaly 50% abdominal pain 7.5% abnormality of the thyroid gland 7.5% acute hepatic failure 7.5% ascites 7.5% cataract 7.5% dementia 7.5% elevated hepatic transaminases 7.5% hepatomegaly 7.5% hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% lymphadenopathy 7.5% malabsorption 7.5% nausea and vomiting 7.5% nystagmus 7.5% recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% self-injurious behavior 7.5% short stature 7.5% sleep disturbance 7.5% splenomegaly 7.5% vasculitis 7.5% weight loss 7.5% acanthocytosis - aggressive behavior - anxiety - areflexia - autosomal recessive inheritance - caudate atrophy - disinhibition - drooling - dysarthria - dysphagia - dystonia - elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - hyporeflexia - limb muscle weakness - mood changes - orofacial dyskinesia - parkinsonism - personality changes - pes cavus - progressive - progressive choreoathetosis - psychosis - self-mutilation of tongue and lips due to involuntary movements - sensory neuropathy - tics - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what is (are) tetralogy of fallot ?,"tetralogy of fallot is a complex congenital heart defect characterized by a large ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles), pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs), an overriding aorta (the aorta - the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body - is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle), and right ventricular hypertrophy (the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual). tetralogy of fallot causes low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin). the cause of this condition is unknown. treatment involves surgery to repair the heart defects. sometimes more than one surgery is needed."
what are the genetic changes related to liddle syndrome ?,"liddle syndrome is caused by mutations in the scnn1b or scnn1g gene. each of these genes provides instructions for making a piece (subunit) of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (enac). these channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, where the channels transport sodium into cells.  in the kidney, enac channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. from the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream (a process called reabsorption) rather than being removed from the body in urine.  mutations in the scnn1b or scnn1g gene change the structure of the respective enac subunit. the changes alter a region of the subunit that is involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation) when it is no longer needed. as a result of the mutations, the subunit proteins are not degraded, and more enac channels remain at the cell surface. the increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia."
what is (are) immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy ?,"immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a term that includes two conditions: immunotactoid glomerulopathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis, which are uncommon causes of glomerular disease. most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities and some experts group these disorders together. fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the 'fibrils' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and  randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have microtubule formations.  both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). the signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy.  both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis c virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and b cell lymphomas. all patients should be screened for these conditions. it is also important to rule out another disease known as amyloidosis. when the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as ""congo red"" the results are negative. in amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids. treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems."

what is (are) shwachman-diamond syndrome ?,"shwachman-diamond syndrome is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow, pancreas, and skeletal system.  the major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. these include red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells, which fight infection; and platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. in shwachman-diamond syndrome, the bone marrow malfunctions and does not make some or all types of white blood cells. a shortage of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell, causes a condition called neutropenia. most people with shwachman-diamond syndrome have at least occasional episodes of neutropenia, which makes them more vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia, recurrent ear infections (otitis media), and skin infections. less commonly, bone marrow abnormalities lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which causes fatigue and weakness, or a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.  people with shwachman-diamond syndrome have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) and aplastic anemia, which are disorders that affect blood cell production, and a cancer of blood-forming tissue known as acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  shwachman-diamond syndrome also affects the pancreas, which is an organ that plays an essential role in digestion. one of this organ's main functions is to produce enzymes that help break down and use the nutrients from food. in most infants with shwachman-diamond syndrome, the pancreas does not produce enough of these enzymes. this condition is known as pancreatic insufficiency. infants with pancreatic insufficiency have trouble digesting food and absorbing nutrients that are needed for growth. as a result, they often have fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea); are slow to grow and gain weight (failure to thrive); and experience malnutrition. pancreatic insufficiency often improves with age in people with shwachman-diamond syndrome.  skeletal abnormalities are another common feature of shwachman-diamond syndrome. many affected individuals have problems with bone formation and growth, most often affecting the hips and knees. low bone density is also frequently associated with this condition. some infants are born with a narrow rib cage and short ribs, which can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. the combination of skeletal abnormalities and slow growth results in short stature in most people with this disorder.  the complications of this condition can affect several other parts of the body, including the liver, heart, endocrine system (which produces hormones), eyes, teeth, and skin. additionally, studies suggest that shwachman-diamond syndrome may be associated with delayed speech and the delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking."
what is (are) pitt-hopkins syndrome ?,"pitt-hopkins syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, breathing problems, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and distinctive facial features.  people with pitt-hopkins syndrome have moderate to severe intellectual disability. most affected individuals have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay). they are delayed in learning to walk and developing fine motor skills such as picking up small items with their fingers. people with pitt-hopkins syndrome typically do not develop speech; some may learn to say a few words. many affected individuals exhibit features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills.  breathing problems in individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome are characterized by episodes of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) followed by periods in which breathing slows or stops (apnea). these episodes can cause a lack of oxygen in the blood, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). in some cases, the lack of oxygen can cause loss of consciousness. some older individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome develop widened and rounded tips of the fingers and toes (clubbing) because of recurrent episodes of decreased oxygen in the blood. the breathing problems occur only when the person is awake and typically first appear in mid-childhood, but they can begin as early as infancy. episodes of hyperventilation and apnea can be triggered by emotions such as excitement or anxiety or by extreme tiredness (fatigue).  epilepsy occurs in most people with pitt-hopkins syndrome and usually begins during childhood, although it can be present from birth.  individuals with pitt-hopkins syndrome have distinctive facial features that include thin eyebrows, sunken eyes, a prominent nose with a high nasal bridge, a pronounced double curve of the upper lip (cupid's bow), a wide mouth with full lips, and widely spaced teeth. the ears are usually thick and cup-shaped.  children with pitt-hopkins syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. however, they can also experience anxiety and behavioral problems.  other features of pitt-hopkins syndrome may include constipation and other gastrointestinal problems, an unusually small head (microcephaly), nearsightedness (myopia), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), short stature, and minor brain abnormalities. affected individuals may also have small hands and feet, a single crease across the palms of the hands, flat feet (pes planus), or unusually fleshy pads at the tips of the fingers and toes. males with pitt-hopkins syndrome may have undescended testes (cryptorchidism)."
what are the symptoms of ehrlichiosis ?,"symptoms  
                
in the united states, the term “ehrlichiosis” may be broadly applied to several different infections. ehrlichia chaffeensis and ehrlichia ewingii are transmitted by the lonestar tick in the southeastern and southcentral united states. in addition, a third ehrlichia species provisionally called ehrlichia muris-like (eml) has been identified in a small number of patients residing in or traveling to minnesota and wisconsin; a tick vector for the eml organism has not yet been established. the symptoms caused by infection with these ehrlichia species usually develop 1-2 weeks after being bitten by an infected tick.  the tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick.  
                
 the following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
 
 - fever 
 - headache 
 - chills 
 - malaise 
 - muscle pain 
 - nausea / vomiting / diarrhea 
 - confusion 
 - conjunctival injection (red eyes) 
 - rash (in up to 60% of children, less than 30% of adults) 
 
                
ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. the estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8%. patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.  
                
 
rash 
                
skin rash is not considered a common feature of ehrlichiosis, and should not be used to rule in or rule out an infection. ehrlichia chaffeensis infection can cause a rash in up to 60% of children, but is reported in fewer than 30% of adults. rash is not commonly reported in patients infected with ehrlichia ewingii or the ehrlichia muris-like organism.  the rash associated with ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range from maculopapular to petechial in nature, and is usually not pruritic (itchy). the rash usually spares the face, but in some cases may spread to the palms and soles.  a type of rash called erythroderma may develop in some patients.  erythroderma is a type of rash that resembles a sunburn and consists of widespread reddening of the skin that may peel after several days.  some patients may develop a rash that resembles the rash of rocky mountain spotted fever making these two diseases difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical signs alone. 
                
 
immune-compromised individuals 
                
the severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids , cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), hiv infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and may also have higher case-fatality rates (i.e. the proportion of patients that die from infection.)   
                
 
blood transfusion and organ transplant risks associated with ehrlichia species 
                
because ehrlichia organisms infect the white blood cells and circulate in the blood stream, these pathogens may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. ehrlichia chaffeensis has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. several instances of suspected e. chaffeensis transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although to date no cases have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission. patients who develop ehrlichiosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens. however, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood; therefore, this process may not eliminate the risk completely.

diagnosis 
                
  
                
the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis must be made based on clinical signs and symptoms, and can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests.  treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result.  
physician diagnosis 
                
there are several aspects of ehrlichiosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  the symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently be negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. 
                
for this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where ehrlichiosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  the healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of ehrlichiosis, but may not be present in all patients depending on the course of the disease.   after a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. 
                
 
laboratory detection 
                
during the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to determine if a patient has ehrlichiosis. this method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. although a positive pcr result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis. 
                
during the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients. 
 
   
  
 
                
the type of blood cell in which morulae are observed may provide insight into the infecting species: e. chaffeensis most commonly infects monocytes, whereas e. ewingii more commonly infect granulocytes. however, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. culture isolation of ehrlichia is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect ehrlichia. 
                
when a person develops ehrlichiosis, their immune system produces antibodies to the ehrlichia, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  it is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out ehrlichiosis as a cause of illness.  
                
the gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa) using e. chaffeensis antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  the first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. in most cases of ehrlichiosis, the first igg ifa titer is typically low, or “negative,” and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in igg antibody levels. igm antibodies usually rise at the same time as igg near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  also, igm antibodies are less specific than igg antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  for these reasons, physicians requesting igm serologic titers should also request a concurrent igg titer. 
                
serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (eia) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. however, eia tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. furthermore, some eia assays rely on the evaluation of igm antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results.  
                
antibodies to e. chaffeensis may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  up to 12% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to ehrlichia species or similar organisms. therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of ehrlichiosis.

treatment 
                
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever ehrlichiosis is suspected.  
                
use of antibiotics other than doxycycline and other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. 
                
if the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  in fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be due to ehrlichiosis. severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  
                
recommended dosage 
                
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
 
 - adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
 - children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days.  some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. 
                
 
treating children 
                
the use of doxycycline to treat suspected ehrlichiosis in children is standard practice recommended by both cdc and the aap committee on infectious diseases. unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat ehrlichiosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected ehrlichiosis in patients of all ages.  
                
 
other treatments 
                
in cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of ehrlichiosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat rocky mountain spotted fever (rmsf), chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of either ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. rifampin appears effective against ehrlichia in laboratory settings. however, rifampin is not effective in treating rmsf, a disease that may be confused with ehrlichiosis. healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against ehrlichiosis, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  
                
 
prophylaxis (preventive treatment) 
                
antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent ehrlichiosis. there is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

other considerations 
                
the clinical presentation for ehrlichiosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as rocky mountain spotted fever and anaplasmosis. similar to ehrlichiosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. for more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm"

what causes harlequin ichthyosis ?,"what causes harlequin ichthyosis? harlequin ichthyosis is caused by mutations in the abca12 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the normal development of skin cells. this protein plays a major role in the transport of fats (lipids) in the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). some mutations in the abca12 gene prevent the cell from making any abca12 protein, while others lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the protein that cannot transport lipids properly. a loss of functional abca12 protein disrupts the normal development of the epidermis, resulting in the hard, thick scales characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis."

what is (are) cardiogenic shock ?,"cardiogenic (kar-dee-oh-je-nik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. the condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away.
                
the most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. however, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. in fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition.
                
if cardiogenic shock does occur, it's very dangerous. when people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death.
                
what is shock?
                
the medical term ""shock"" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening.
                
shock can have many causes. cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. other types of shock include hypovolemic (hy-po-vo-lee-mik) shock and vasodilatory (vaz-oh-dile-ah-tor-e) shock.
                
hypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss.
                
in vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. when the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs.
                
a bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock.
                
when a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body's organs. if shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. if shock isn't treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death.
                
some of the signs and symptoms of shock include:
                
confusion or lack of alertness
                
loss of consciousness
                
a sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat
                
sweating
                
pale skin
                
a weak pulse
                
rapid breathing
                
decreased or no urine output
                
cool hands and feet
                
if you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs.
                
outlook
                
in the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. this is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices. these treatments can restore blood flow to the heart and help the heart pump better.
                
in some cases, devices that take over the pumping function of the heart are used. implanting these devices requires major surgery."
how to diagnose gestational trophoblastic disease ?,"tests that examine the uterus are used to detect (find) and diagnose gestational trophoblastic disease. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   pelvic exam : an exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. a speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. a pap test of the cervix is usually done. the doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. the doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   ultrasound exam of the pelvis: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the pelvis and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. sometimes a transvaginal ultrasound (tvus) will be done. for tvus, an ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina to make the sonogram.     -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. blood is also tested to check the liver, kidney, and bone marrow.     -   serum tumor marker test : a procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. these are called tumor markers. for gtd, the blood is checked for the level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg), a hormone that is made by the body during pregnancy. -hcg in the blood of a woman who is not pregnant may be a sign of gtd.    -   urinalysis : a test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, bacteria, and the level of -hcg."

how to diagnose rheumatic fever ?,"how is rheumatic fever diagnosed? a diagnosis of rheumatic fever is usually based on the following: characteristic signs and symptoms identified by physical examination and/or specialized testing such as a blood test, chest x-ray and echocardiogram confirmation of group a streptococcus bacterial infection with a throat culture or blood tests the diagnosis can also be supported by blood tests that confirm the presence of certain proteins that increase in response to inflammation (called acute-phase reactants) and tend to be elevated in rheumatic fever. additional tests may be recommended to rule out other conditions that cause similar features."
what are the genetic changes related to sporadic hemiplegic migraine ?,"mutations in the atp1a2 and cacna1a genes have been found to cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine. the proteins produced from these genes transport charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. the movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. signaling between neurons relies on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. mutations in the atp1a2 and cacna1a genes disrupt the transport of ions in neurons, which is thought to impair the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. the resulting abnormal signaling may lead to the severe headaches and auras characteristic of sporadic hemiplegic migraine.  many people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine do not have a mutation in one of the known genes. researchers believe that mutations in other genes are also involved in the condition, although these genes have not been identified.  there is little evidence that mutations in the cacna1a and atp1a2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as sporadic hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine."
is autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered lgi1 gene in each cell is sufficient to raise the risk of developing epilepsy. about two-thirds of people who inherit a mutation in this gene will develop seizures. in most cases, an affected person has one affected parent and other relatives with the condition."
what are the treatments for peripheral arterial disease (p.a.d.) ?,"yes. in some people, lifestyle changes are not enough to control p.a.d. surgery and other procedures may be needed. these may include bypass grafting surgery, angioplasty, a stent, or a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee). - your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. in this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. this graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. this surgery doesn't cure p.a.d., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.  your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. in this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. this graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. this surgery doesn't cure p.a.d., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb. - angioplasty is used to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blocked artery. during this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon or other device on the end is inserted into a blocked artery. the balloon is inflated, which pushes the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. this widens the artery and restores blood flow.  angioplasty is used to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blocked artery. during this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon or other device on the end is inserted into a blocked artery. the balloon is inflated, which pushes the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. this widens the artery and restores blood flow. - a stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. a stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure is done. some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. a stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. a stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure is done. some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. - a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee) may be used to remove plaque buildup from an artery. during the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. the device is used to shave or cut off the plaque. the bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). doctors also can do atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage. a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee) may be used to remove plaque buildup from an artery. during the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. the device is used to shave or cut off the plaque. the bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). doctors also can do atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage."

what is (are) parathyroid disorders ?,"most people have four pea-sized glands, called parathyroid glands, on the thyroid gland in the neck. though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. the parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (pth), which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.    if your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone, it disrupts this balance. if they secrete extra pth, you have hyperparathyroidism, and your blood calcium rises. in many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. very rarely, the cause is cancer.    if you do not have enough pth, you have hypoparathyroidism. your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. causes include injury to the glands, endocrine disorders, or genetic conditions. treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what are the genetic changes related to congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency ?,"mutations in the si gene cause congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. the si gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme sucrase-isomaltase. this enzyme is found in the small intestine and is responsible for breaking down sucrose and maltose into their simple sugar components. these simple sugars are then absorbed by the small intestine. mutations that cause this condition alter the structure, disrupt the production, or impair the function of sucrase-isomaltase. these changes prevent the enzyme from breaking down sucrose and maltose, causing the intestinal discomfort seen in individuals with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency."

how to prevent hypoglycemia ?,"diabetes treatment plans are designed to match the dose and timing of medication to a person's usual schedule of meals and activities. mismatches could result in hypoglycemia. for example, taking a dose of insulinor other medication that increases insulin levelsbut then skipping a meal could result in hypoglycemia.
                
to help prevent hypoglycemia, people with diabetes should always consider the following:
                
- their diabetes medications. a health care provider can explain which diabetes medications can cause hypoglycemia and explain how and when to take medications. for good diabetes management, people with diabetes should take diabetes medications in the recommended doses at the recommended times. in some cases, health care providers may suggest that patients learn how to adjust medications to match changes in their schedule or routine.  - their meal plan. a registered dietitian can help design a meal plan that fits one's personal preferences and lifestyle. following one's meal plan is important for managing diabetes. people with diabetes should eat regular meals, have enough food at each meal, and try not to skip meals or snacks. snacks are particularly important for some people before going to sleep or exercising. some snacks may be more effective than others in preventing hypoglycemia overnight. the dietitian can make recommendations for snacks.  - their daily activity. to help prevent hypoglycemia caused by physical activity, health care providers may advise      - checking blood glucose before sports, exercise, or other physical activity and having a snack if the level is below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl)    - adjusting medication before physical activity    - checking blood glucose at regular intervals during extended periods of physical activity and having snacks as needed    - checking blood glucose periodically after physical activity    - their use of alcoholic beverages. drinking alcoholic beverages, especially on an empty stomach, can cause hypoglycemia, even a day or two later. heavy drinking can be particularly dangerous for people taking insulin or medications that increase insulin production. alcoholic beverages should always be consumed with a snack or meal at the same time. a health care provider can suggest how to safely include alcohol in a meal plan.  - their diabetes management plan. intensive diabetes managementkeeping blood glucose as close to the normal range as possible to prevent long-term complicationscan increase the risk of hypoglycemia. those whose goal is tight control should talk with a health care provider about ways to prevent hypoglycemia and how best to treat it if it occurs.
                
what to ask the doctor about diabetes medications
                
people who take diabetes medications should ask their doctor or health care provider
                
- whether their diabetes medications could cause hypoglycemia  - when they should take their diabetes medications  - how much medication they should take  - whether they should keep taking their diabetes medications when they are sick  - whether they should adjust their medications before physical activity  - whether they should adjust their medications if they skip a meal"

how to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis ?,"a health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy.
                
a health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person's health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver. a person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders.
                
blood tests. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. a person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, or wilson disease.
                
liver biopsy. a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. he or she may also ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.
                
during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. a health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. if needed, he or she will give sedatives and pain medication. then, he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue, and may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. after the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
a health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. the liver sample is sent to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patient's health care provider.
                
a health care provider can use liver biopsy to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and determine if cirrhosis is present. people often have cirrhosis at the time they are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. a health care provider can also use liver biopsy to look for changes in the severity of liver damage prior to ending treatment for autoimmune hepatitis."
what is (are) prostate cancer ?,"sometimes, cancer cells break away from the malignant tumor in the prostate and enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and travel to other organs in the body. when cancer spreads from its original location in the prostate to another part of the body such as the bone, it is called metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer. doctors sometimes call this ""distant"" disease."
what causes diabetes ?,"type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. in an autoimmune reaction, antibodies, or immune cells, attach to the body's own healthy tissues by mistake, signaling the body to attack them. at present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas in people with type 1 diabetes. however, many believe that both genetic factors and environmental factors are involved. studies now are underway to identify these factors and prevent type 1 diabetes in people at risk. type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.  get more details about who should be tested for diabetes."
what are the genetic changes related to recurrent hydatidiform mole ?,"mutations in the nlrp7 or khdc3l gene can cause recurrent hydatidiform mole, with nlrp7 gene mutations being the most common cause.  within egg cells (oocytes), both the nlrp7 and khdc3l proteins are thought to play a role in turning off (inactivating) certain genes based on which parent the copy of the gene came from, a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. for most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. for a small subset of genes, however, only one of the two copies is active; for some of these genes, the copy from the father is normally active, while for others, the copy from the mother is normally active. the nlrp7 and khdc3l proteins are likely involved in imprinting multiple maternal genes in oocytes, ensuring that they will be inactive in the developing embryo; the corresponding paternal genes are active.  nlrp7 or khdc3l gene mutations result in the production of proteins with impaired function. as a result, multiple genes that contribute to a developing embryo are not imprinted properly, leading to abnormal gene activity (expression) in all pregnancies. because many genes that would normally be inactive are instead active, embryonic development is impaired, resulting in a hydatidiform mole.  the nlrp7 protein has also been found to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell maturation (differentiation). research suggests that the nlrp7 protein plays an additional role in immune responses by regulating the release of an immune protein called interleukin-1 beta. normally, the immune system would recognize a hydatidiform mole as a non-growing pregnancy or foreign tissue and signal the body to remove it. because the impaired nlrp7 protein slows interleukin-1 beta release, the body cannot trigger an immune response to the abnormal pregnancy. instead, the hydatidiform mole remains in the body. the cause of the retention of the pregnancy in women with khdc3l gene mutations is unclear.  in some cases of recurrent hydatidiform mole, no mutations in either of these genes have been identified. in these instances, the cause of the condition is unknown.  when there is only a single instance of hydatidiform mole, it is often caused by abnormal fertilization of an egg. in sporadic hydatidiform mole, the embryo either receives genetic information only from sperm cells because the egg has no dna-containing nucleus, or the embryo receives too much genetic information because two sperm cells fertilized one egg."

what is (are) monilethrix ?,"monilethrix is a condition that affects hair growth. its most characteristic feature is that individual strands of hair have a beaded appearance like the beads of a necklace. the name monilethrix comes from the latin word for necklace (monile) and the greek word for hair (thrix). noticeable when viewed under a microscope, the beaded appearance is due to periodic narrowing of the hair shaft. people with monilethrix also have sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) and short, brittle hair that breaks easily.  affected individuals usually have normal hair at birth, but the hair abnormalities develop within the first few months of life. in mild cases of monilethrix, only hair on the back of the head (occiput) or nape of the neck is affected. in more severe cases, hair over the whole scalp can be affected, as well as pubic hair, underarm hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, or hair on the arms and legs.  occasionally, the skin and nails are involved in monilethrix. some affected individuals have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris, which causes small bumps on the skin, especially on the scalp, neck, and arms. affected individuals may also have abnormal fingernails or toenails."
is myd88 deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) vasculitis syndromes of the central and peripheral nervous systems ?,"vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels, which includes the veins, arteries, and capillaries. inflammation occurs with infection or is thought to be due to a faulty immune system response. it also can be caused by other immune system disease, an allergic reaction to medicines or toxins, and by certain blood cancers. vasculitic disorders can cause problems in any organ system, including the central (cns) and peripheral (pns) nervous systems. vasculitis disorders, or syndromes, of the cns and pns are characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in and around blood vessels, and secondary narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels that nourish the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves.
                
a vasculitic syndrome may begin suddenly or develop over time. symptoms include headaches, especially a headache that doesnt go away; fever, rapid weight loss; confusion or forgetfulness leading to dementia; swelling of the brain, pain while chewing or swallowing; paralysis or numbness, usually in the arms or legs; and visual disturbances, such as double vision, blurred vision, or blindness

what are the symptoms of what i need to know about my child's urinary tract infection ?,"a child with a uti may not have any symptoms. when symptoms are present, they can range from mild to severe. uti symptoms can include
                
- fever  - pain or burning during urination with only a few drops of urine at a time  - irritability  - not eating  - nausea  - diarrhea  - vomiting  - cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - urinating often  - pain in the back or side below the ribs  - leaking urine into clothes or bedding in older children"
what is (are) hypoglycemia ?,"hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose or low blood sugar, occurs when blood glucose drops below normal levels. glucose, an important source of energy for the body, comes from food. carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods.
                
after a meal, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the cells use glucose for energy. if a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time, the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. the body can use glycogen for energy between meals. extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. fat can also be used for energy.
                
when blood glucose begins to fall, glucagonanother hormone made by the pancreassignals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. in some people with diabetes, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. but with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production, glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range.
                
hypoglycemia can happen suddenly. it is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. if left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness, or fainting. severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
                
in adults and children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. hypoglycemia can also result, however, from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors."

what is (are) dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome ?,"dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (dcma) syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features affecting multiple body systems.  beginning in infancy to early childhood, most people with dcma syndrome develop dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. some affected individuals also have long qt syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. the irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death. rarely, heart problems improve over time; however, in most cases of dcma syndrome, affected individuals do not survive past childhood due to heart failure. a small percentage of people with dcma syndrome have no heart problems at all.  by age 2, children with dcma syndrome have problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). these movement problems can result in delay of motor skills such as standing and walking, but most older children with dcma syndrome can walk without support.  in addition to heart problems and movement difficulties, most individuals with dcma syndrome grow slowly before and after birth, which leads to short stature. additionally, many affected individuals have mild intellectual disability. many males with dcma syndrome have genital abnormalities such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). other common features of dcma syndrome include unusually small red blood cells (microcytic anemia), which can cause pale skin; an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver (hepatic steatosis), which can damage the liver; and the degeneration of nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerve atrophy), which can lead to vision loss.  dcma syndrome is associated with increased levels of a substance called 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. the amount of acid does not appear to influence the signs and symptoms of the condition. dcma syndrome is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). people with dcma syndrome also have high urine levels of another acid called 3-methylglutaric acid."
how to diagnose best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,"how is best vitelliform macular dystrophy diagnosed? best vitelliform macular dystrophy (bvmd) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (eog); and the family history. an eye exam may include other tests as well. a fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. an eog is usually abnormal in affected people, but occasionally, people with signs of bvmd and a mutation in the best1 gene have a normal eog. the family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of bvmd. a best1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. in people with no family history of bvmd, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. the exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person's ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered."
what is (are) pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ?,"pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (pha1) is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. however, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. however, people with pha1 have high levels of aldosterone.  there are two types of pha1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. one type, called autosomal dominant pha1 (also known as renal pha1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. this form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. the other type, called autosomal recessive pha1 (also known as generalized or systemic pha1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. this type of pha1 is more severe and does not improve with age.  the earliest signs of both types of pha1 are usually the inability to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. the characteristic features of both types of pha1 are excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), which leads to low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). infants with pha1 can also have high levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness in infants with pha1.  infants with autosomal recessive pha1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. affected individuals may experience episodes of abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. they may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. although adults with autosomal recessive pha1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) kallmann syndrome ?,"kallmann syndrome (ks) is a condition characterized primarily by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hh) and absent or diminished sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia, respectively). hh is present from birth and is due to deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh). ks is often diagnosed at puberty due to lack of sexual development, but may be suspected in male infants with undescended testicles or an unusually small penis. untreated adult males may have decreased bone density and muscle mass; decreased testicular volume; erectile dysfunction; diminished libido; and infertility. untreated adult females almost always have absent menstruation with normal, little, or no breast development. in rare cases, features may include failure of kidney development (renal agenesis); hearing impairment; cleft lip or palate; and/or dental abnormalities. most cases of ks are sporadic but some types are familial. the inheritance pattern differs depending on the genetic cause. treatment includes hormone replacement therapy for sexual development. fertility can be achieved in most cases."
what is (are) neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation ?,"neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (nbia) is a rare, inherited, neurological movement disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain and progressive degeneration of the nervous system. symptoms, which vary greatly among patients and usually develop during childhood, may include dystonia (slow writhing, distorting muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk), dysarthria (slurred or slow speech) choreoathetosis (involuntary, purposeless jerky muscle movements), muscle rigidity (uncontrolled tightness of the muscles), spasticity (sudden, involuntary muscle spasms), and/or ataxia (inability to coordinate movements), confusion, disorientation, seizures, stupor, and dementia. visual changes are also common, most often due to atrophy of the optic nerve (optic atrophy) or degeneration of the retinal layer in the back of the eye (retinal degeneration cognitive decline occurs in some forms of nbia; the majority of individuals with nbia do not have cognitive impairment. several genes have been found that cause nbia."
how to diagnose olivopontocerebellar atrophy ?,"how is olivopontocerebellar atrophy diagnosed? a diagnosis of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (opca) may be based on a thorough medical exam; the presence of signs and symptoms; imaging studies; various laboratory tests; and an evaluation of the family history. mri of the brain may show characteristics of opca, such as specific changes in the size of affected parts of the brain. this is more likely as the disease progresses; it is possible to have opca and have a normal brain mri (especially within the first year of symptom onset). hereditary opca may be suspected based on having a family history, and may be diagnosed by genetic testing (when available) for the condition suspected or known to be present in the family. sporadic opca may be diagnosed if hereditary forms of opca, and other conditions associated with opca, have been ruled out."

                    - there are different types of treatment for patients with transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter.    - one type of standard treatment is used:         - surgery        - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - fulguration     - segmental resection of the renal pelvis     - laser surgery     - regional chemotherapy and regional biologic therapy        - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter.
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    one type of standard treatment is used:
                    surgery    one of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter:            -  nephroureterectomy: surgery to remove the entire kidney, the ureter, and the bladder cuff (tissue that connects the ureter to the bladder).     -  segmental resection of the ureter: a surgical procedure to remove the part of the ureter that contains cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. the ends of the ureter are then reattached. this treatment is used when the cancer is superficial and in the lower third of the ureter only, near the bladder.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci web site.     fulguration     fulguration is a surgical procedure that destroys tissue using an electric current. a tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn away the tumor with electricity.       segmental resection of the renal pelvis    this is a surgical procedure to remove localized cancer from the renal pelvis without removing the entire kidney. segmental resection may be done to save kidney function when the other kidney is damaged or has already been removed.        laser surgery    a laser beam (narrow beam of intense light) is used as a knife to remove the cancer. a laser beam can also be used to kill the cancer cells. this procedure may also be called or laser fulguration.       regional chemotherapy and regional biologic therapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer; substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. regional treatment means the anticancer drugs or biologic substances are placed directly into an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen, so the drugs will affect cancer cells in that area. clinical trials are studying chemotherapy or biologic therapy using drugs placed directly into the renal pelvis or the ureter.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what are the symptoms of coronary heart disease ?,"a common symptom of coronary heart disease (chd) is angina. angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.
                
angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. you also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. angina pain may even feel like indigestion. the pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. emotional stress also can trigger the pain.
                
another common symptom of chd is shortness of breath. this symptom occurs if chd causes heart failure. when you have heart failure, your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. fluid builds up in your lungs, making it hard to breathe.
                
the severity of these symptoms varies. they may get more severe as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries.
                
signs and symptoms of heart problems related to coronary heart disease
                
some people who have chd have no signs or symptomsa condition called silent chd. the disease might not be diagnosed until a person has signs or symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat).
                
heart attack
                
a heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. this can happen if an area of plaque in a coronary artery ruptures (breaks open).
                
blood cell fragments called platelets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. if a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.
                
if the blockage isnt treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. this heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.
                
heart with muscle damage and a blocked artery
                

                

                
the most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back.
                
the discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. the feeling can be mild or severe. heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn.
                
the symptoms of angina can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest.
                
chest pain or discomfort that doesnt go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while youre resting) might be a sign of a heart attack. if you dont know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911.
                
all chest pain should be checked by a doctor.
                
other common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:
                
upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach
                
shortness of breath, which may occur with or before chest discomfort
                
nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, light-headedness or fainting, or breaking out in a cold sweat
                
sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), or lack of energy

heart failure
                
heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working.
                
the most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing; fatigue; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, stomach, and veins in the neck.
                
all of these symptoms are the result of fluid buildup in your body. when symptoms start, you may feel tired and short of breath after routine physical effort, like climbing stairs.
                
for more information, go to the health topics heart failure article.
                
arrhythmia
                
an arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. when you have an arrhythmia, you may notice that your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast.
                
some people describe arrhythmias as a fluttering feeling in the chest. these feelings are called palpitations (pal-pih-ta-shuns).
                
some arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. this condition is called sudden cardiac arrest (sca). sca usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes.

how to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?,"nash is usually first suspected in a person who is found to have elevations in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels, such as alanine aminotransferase (alt) or aspartate aminotransferase (ast). when further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, nash is suspected. the only means of proving a diagnosis of nash and separating it from simple fatty liver is a liver biopsy. for a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. nash is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. if the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or nafld is diagnosed. an important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. currently, no blood tests or scans can reliably provide this information."

is arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) renal tubular acidosis with deafness ?,"renal tubular acidosis with deafness is a disorder characterized by kidney (renal) problems and hearing loss. the kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with this disorder, the kidneys do not remove enough acidic compounds from the body. instead, the acids are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the blood becomes too acidic. this chemical imbalance, called metabolic acidosis, can result in a range of signs and symptoms that vary in severity. metabolic acidosis often causes nausea, vomiting, and dehydration; affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). most children and adults with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have short stature, and many develop kidney stones.  the metabolic acidosis that occurs in renal tubular acidosis with deafness may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. this bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. rarely, people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have episodes of hypokalemic paralysis, a condition that causes extreme muscle weakness associated with low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).  in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) usually begins between childhood and young adulthood, and gradually gets worse. an inner ear abnormality affecting both ears occurs in most people with this disorder. this feature, which is called enlarged vestibular aqueduct, can be seen with medical imaging. the vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that runs from the inner ear into the temporal bone of the skull and toward the brain. the relationship between enlarged vestibular aqueduct and hearing loss is unclear. in renal tubular acidosis with deafness, enlarged vestibular aqueduct typically occurs in individuals whose hearing loss begins in childhood."
what are the genetic changes related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"the cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is unknown, although the disease probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. it is likely that genetic changes increase a person's risk of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and then exposure to certain environmental factors triggers the disease.  changes in several genes have been suggested as risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. most of these genetic changes account for only a small proportion of cases. however, mutations in genes known as terc and tert have been found in about 15 percent of all cases of familial pulmonary fibrosis and a smaller percentage of cases of sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. the terc and tert genes provide instructions for making components of an enzyme called telomerase, which maintains structures at the ends of chromosomes known as telomeres. it is not well understood how defects in telomerase are associated with the lung damage characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  researchers have also examined environmental risk factors that could contribute to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. these factors include exposure to wood or metal dust, viral infections, certain medications, and cigarette smoking. some research suggests that gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) may also be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; affected individuals may breathe in (aspirate) stomach contents, which over time could damage the lungs."
what causes hemolytic uremic syndrome in children ?,"the most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children is an escherichia coli (e. coli) infection of the digestive system. the digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal, or gi, tracta series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusand other organs that help the body break down and absorb food.
                
normally, harmless strains, or types, of e. coli are found in the intestines and are an important part of digestion. however, if a child becomes infected with the o157:h7 strain of e. coli, the bacteria will lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream. the toxins travel through the bloodstream and can destroy the red blood cells. e.coli o157:h7 can be found in
                
- undercooked meat, most often ground beef  - unpasteurized, or raw, milk  - unwashed, contaminated raw fruits and vegetables  - contaminated juice  - contaminated swimming pools or lakes
                
less common causes, sometimes called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, can include
                
- taking certain medications, such as chemotherapy  - having other viral or bacterial infections  - inheriting a certain type of hemolytic uremicsyndrome that runs in families

who is at risk for nasopharyngeal cancer? ?,"ethnic background and being exposed to the epstein-barr virus can affect the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer include the following:         - having chinese or asian ancestry.    - being exposed to the epstein-barr virus: the epstein-barr virus has been associated with certain cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and some lymphomas.    - drinking large amounts of alcohol."
what are the genetic changes related to autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of charlevoix-saguenay ?,"mutations in the sacs gene cause arsacs. the sacs gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sacsin. sacsin is found in the brain, skin cells, muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), and at low levels in the pancreas, but the specific function of the protein is unknown. research suggests that sacsin might play a role in folding newly produced proteins into the proper 3-dimensional shape because it shares similar regions with other proteins that perform this function. mutations in the sacs gene cause the production of an unstable sacsin protein that does not function normally. it is unclear how the abnormal sacsin protein affects the brain and skeletal muscles and results in the signs and symptoms of arsacs."
is familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. rarely, both copies of the gene are altered, leading to more severe signs and symptoms.  in most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition."
what are the symptoms of ring chromosome 8 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of ring chromosome 8? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for ring chromosome 8. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the palate 90% abnormality of the ureter 90% anteverted nares 90% cognitive impairment 90% deviation of finger 90% epicanthus 90% frontal bossing 90% high forehead 90% low posterior hairline 90% polyhydramnios 90% round ear 90% short nose 90% sloping forehead 90% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects ?,"mutations in the nsdhl gene cause child syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the production of cholesterol. cholesterol is a type of fat that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals, particularly egg yolks, meat, fish, and dairy products. although high cholesterol levels are a well-known risk factor for heart disease, the body needs some cholesterol to develop and function normally both before and after birth. cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and the protective substance covering nerve cells (myelin). additionally, cholesterol plays a role in the production of certain hormones and digestive acids.  the mutations that underlie child syndrome eliminate the activity of the nsdhl enzyme, which disrupts the normal production of cholesterol within cells. a shortage of this enzyme may also allow potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol production to build up in the body's tissues. researchers suspect that low cholesterol levels and/or an accumulation of other substances disrupt the growth and development of many parts of the body. it is not known, however, how a disturbance in cholesterol production leads to the specific features of child syndrome."
what is (are) toilet training ?,"is your child ready to use a potty? the more important question may be, are you? children are usually ready around ages 18-24 months. they often signal that they are ready by letting you know when their diapers need changing. you should be prepared to commit to three months of daily encouragement. successful trips to the potty should be rewarded. missteps shouldn't get as much attention. training requires patience. if it is not successful, it may mean your child is not ready."
what is (are) pendred syndrome ?,"pendred syndrome is a disorder typically associated with hearing loss and a thyroid condition called a goiter. a goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck that produces hormones. if a goiter develops in a person with pendred syndrome, it usually forms between late childhood and early adulthood. in most cases, this enlargement does not cause the thyroid to malfunction.  in most people with pendred syndrome, severe to profound hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) is evident at birth. less commonly, hearing loss does not develop until later in infancy or early childhood. some affected individuals also have problems with balance caused by dysfunction of the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation.  an inner ear abnormality called an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) is a characteristic feature of pendred syndrome. the vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that connects the inner ear with the inside of the skull. some affected individuals also have an abnormally shaped cochlea, which is a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear that helps process sound. the combination of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct and an abnormally shaped cochlea is known as mondini malformation.  pendred syndrome shares features with other hearing loss and thyroid conditions, and it is unclear whether they are best considered as separate disorders or as a spectrum of related signs and symptoms. these conditions include a form of nonsyndromic hearing loss (hearing loss that does not affect other parts of the body) called dfnb4, and, in a small number of people, a form of congenital hypothyroidism resulting from an abnormally small thyroid gland (thyroid hypoplasia). all of these conditions are caused by mutations in the same gene."
is rippling muscle disease inherited ?,"rippling muscle disease is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it is occasionally inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered cav3 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person has one parent with rippling muscle disease or another caveolinopathy. rare cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of caveolinopathies in their family.  autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the cav3 gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. people with autosomal recessive rippling muscle disease generally have more severe signs and symptoms than do people with the autosomal dominant form."

is progressive external ophthalmoplegia inherited ?,"progressive external ophthalmoplegia can have different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved.  when this condition is caused by mutations in the mt-tl1 gene, it is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtdna. because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children.  when the nuclear genes polg, slc25a4, or c10orf2 are involved, progressive external ophthalmoplegia is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  certain mutations in the polg gene can also cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  some mutations in the polg gene that cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia occur during a person's lifetime and are not inherited. these genetic changes are called somatic mutations."
what are the symptoms of lujo hemorrhagic fever (luhf) ?,"the symptoms of lujo hemorrhagic fever, as described in the five patients in the original cluster outbreak, resemble those of severe lassa fever. after an incubation period of 7 to 13 days, the clinical course started by a non-specific febrile illness accompanied by headache and muscle pain. 
                
the disease increases in severity, with: 
 
 - a morbilliform rash of the face and trunk 
 - face and neck swelling 
 - pharyngitis (sore throat) 
 - diarrhea 
 
                
bleeding was not a prominent feature during the illness. 
                
in the fatal cases (4/5 patients), a transient improvement was followed by: 
 
 - rapid deterioration with respiratory distress 
 - neurological signs and circulatory collapse 
 
                
death occurred 10 to 13 days after onset. 
                
low blood platelets, low white blood cell count (at the onset, rising later on) and elevated liver function values were present in all patients. 
                
since arenaviruses may enter the fetus through infection of the mother, and anectodal evidence suggests that infected pregnant women may suffer miscarriages, it is reasonable to assume that both infection of the fetus and miscarriage may be associated with lujo infection in the mother."
what is (are) shaken baby syndrome ?,"shaken baby syndrome is a type of inflicted traumatic brain injury that happens when a baby is violently shaken. a baby has weak neck muscles and a large, heavy head. shaking makes the fragile brain bounce back and forth inside the skull and causes bruising, swelling, and bleeding, which can lead to permanent, severe brain damage or death. the characteristic injuries of shaken baby syndrome are subdural hemorrhages (bleeding in the brain), retinal hemorrhages (bleeding in the retina), damage to the spinal cord and neck, and fractures of the ribs and bones. these injuries may not be immediately noticeable. symptoms of shaken baby syndrome include extreme irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, breathing problems, convulsions, vomiting, and pale or bluish skin. shaken baby injuries usually occur in children younger than 2 years old, but may be seen in children up to the age of 5."

what causes hypotension ?,"conditions or factors that disrupt the body's ability to control blood pressure cause hypotension. the different types of hypotension have different causes.
                
orthostatic hypotension
                
orthostatic hypotension has many causes. sometimes two or more factors combine to cause this type of low blood pressure.
                
dehydration (de-hi-dra-shun) is the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension. dehydration occurs if the body loses more water than it takes in.
                
you may become dehydrated if you don't drink enough fluids or if you sweat a lot during physical activity. fever, vomiting, and severe diarrhea also can cause dehydration.
                
orthostatic hypotension also may occur during pregnancy, but it usually goes away after birth.
                
because an older body doesn't manage changes in blood pressure as well as a younger body, getting older also can lead to this type of hypotension.
                
postprandial hypotension (a type of orthostatic hypotension) mostly affects older adults. postprandial hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure after a meal.
                
certain medical conditions can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension, including:
                
heart conditions, such as heart attack, heart valve disease, bradycardia (a very low heart rate), and heart failure. these conditions prevent the heart from pumping enough blood to the body.
                
anemia.
                
severe infections.
                
endocrine conditions, such as thyroid disorders, addison's disease, low blood sugar, and diabetes.
                
central nervous system disorders, such as parkinson's disease.
                
pulmonary embolism.
                
some medicines for high blood pressure and heart disease can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension. these medicines include:
                
diuretics, also called ""water pills""
                
calcium channel blockers
                
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors
                
angiotensin ii receptor blockers
                
nitrates
                
beta blockers
                
medicines for conditions such as anxiety, depression, erectile dysfunction, and central nervous system disorders also can increase your risk of orthostatic hypotension.
                
other substances, when taken with high blood pressure medicines, also can lead to orthostatic hypotension. these substances include alcohol, barbiturates, and some prescription and over-the-counter medicines.
                
finally, other factors or conditions that can trigger orthostatic hypotension include being out in the heat or being immobile for a long time. ""immobile"" means you can't move around very much.
                
neurally mediated hypotension
                
neurally mediated hypotension (nmh) occurs when the brain and heart don't communicate with each other properly.
                
for example, when you stand for a long time, blood begins to pool in your legs. this causes your blood pressure to drop. in nmh, the body mistakenly tells the brain that blood pressure is high. in response, the brain slows the heart rate. this makes blood pressure drop even more, causing dizziness and other symptoms.
                
severe hypotension linked to shock
                
many factors and conditions can cause severe hypotension linked to shock. some of these factors also can cause orthostatic hypotension. in shock, though, blood pressure drops very low and doesn't return to normal on its own.
                
shock is an emergency and must be treated right away. if a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911.
                
some severe infections can cause shock. this is known as septic shock. it can occur if bacteria enter the bloodstream. the bacteria release a toxin (poison) that leads to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.
                
a severe loss of blood or fluids from the body also can cause shock. this is known as hypovolemic (hi-po-vo-le-mik) shock. hypovolemic shock can happen as a result of:
                
major external bleeding (for example, from a severe cut or injury)
                
major internal bleeding (for example, from a ruptured blood vessel or injury that causes bleeding inside the body)
                
major loss of body fluids from severe burns
                
severe swelling of the pancreas (an organ that produces enzymes and hormones, such as insulin)
                
severe diarrhea
                
severe kidney disease
                
overuse of diuretics
                
a major decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood also can cause shock. this is known as cardiogenic (kar-de-o-jen-ik) shock.
                
a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or an ongoing arrhythmia (ah-rith-me-ah) that disrupts heart function can cause this type of shock.
                
a sudden and extreme relaxation of the arteries linked to a drop in blood pressure also can cause shock. this is known as vasodilatory (va-so-di-la-tory) shock. it can occur due to:
                
a severe head injury
                
a reaction to certain medicines
                
liver failure
                
poisoning
                
a severe allergic reaction (called anaphylactic (an-a-fi-lak-tik) shock)"

what causes what i need to know about gas ?,"you can try to find the cause of gas by keeping a diary of what you eat and drink and how often you burp, pass gas, or have other symptoms. the diary may help you identify the foods that cause you to have gas.
                
talk with your health care provider if
                
- gas symptoms often bother you  - your symptoms change suddenly  - you have new symptoms, especially if you are older than age 40  - you have other symptomssuch as constipation, diarrhea, or weight lossalong with gas
                

                
your health care provider will ask about your diet and symptoms. your health care provider may review your diary to see if specific foods are causing gas.
                
if milk or milk products are causing gas, your health care provider may perform blood or breath tests to check for lactose intolerance. lactose intolerance means you have trouble digesting lactose. your health care provider may ask you to avoid milk and milk products for a short time to see if your gas symptoms improve.
                
your health care provider may test for other digestive problems, depending on your symptoms."

who is at risk for adult hodgkin lymphoma? ?,"age, gender, and epstein-barr infection can affect the risk of adult hodgkin lymphoma. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for adult hodgkin lymphoma include the following:         - being in young or late adulthood.     - being male.     - being infected with the epstein-barr virus.    - having a first-degree relative (parent, brother, or sister) with hodgkin lymphoma.        pregnancy is not a risk factor for hodgkin lymphoma."
what are the genetic changes related to axenfeld-rieger syndrome ?,"axenfeld-rieger syndrome results from mutations in at least two known genes, pitx2 and foxc1. pitx2 gene mutations cause type 1, and foxc1 gene mutations cause type 3. the gene associated with type 2 is likely located on chromosome 13, but it has not been identified. the proteins produced from the pitx2 and foxc1 genes are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to dna and help control the activity of other genes. these transcription factors are active before birth in the developing eye and in other parts of the body. they appear to play important roles in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of structures in the anterior segment of the eye.  mutations in either the pitx2 or foxc1 gene disrupt the activity of other genes that are needed for normal development. impaired regulation of these genes leads to problems in the formation of the anterior segment of the eye and other parts of the body. these developmental abnormalities underlie the characteristic features of axenfeld-rieger syndrome. affected individuals with pitx2 gene mutations are more likely than those with foxc1 gene mutations to have abnormalities affecting parts of the body other than the eye.  some people with axenfeld-rieger syndrome do not have identified mutations in the pitx2 or foxc1 genes. in these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown. other as-yet-unidentified genes may also cause axenfeld-rieger syndrome."
what is (are) primary orthostatic hypotension ?,"primary orthostatic hypotension is a rare type of orthostatic hypotension. it is not a disease per se, but a condition caused by several disorders that affect a specific part of the autonomic nervous system, such as multiple system atrophy, young-onset parkinsons disease, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, familial dysautonomia, and pure autonomic failure among others. the autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that regulates certain involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder control. orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that happens when standing-up from sitting or lying down. common symptoms may include dizziness, lightheadedness, generalized weakness, leg buckling, nausea, blurry vision, fatigue, and headaches. additional symptoms can include chest pain (angina), head and neck pain (often affecting neck and shoulders with a coat hanger distribution), decline in cognitive functioning such as difficulty concentrating, temporary loss of consciousness or blackout. some people with primary orthostatic hypotension may also have high blood pressure when lying down. the treatment depends upon several factors including the specific underlying cause including the treatment depends upon several factors including the specific underlying cause and may include physical counter-maneuvers like lying down, sitting down, squatting clenching buttocks, leg crossing, and support garment and medication."

how to diagnose mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome ?,"tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps, the number and type of skin lesions, or anything else that seems unusual. pictures of the skin and a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   complete blood count with differential : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - the number of red blood cells and platelets.      - the number and type of white blood cells.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.       - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   peripheral blood smear : a procedure in which a sample of blood is viewed under a microscope to count different circulating blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) and see whether the cells look normal.     -  skin biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. the doctor may remove a growth from the skin, which will be examined by a pathologist. more than one skin biopsy may be needed to diagnose mycosis fungoides.    -   immunophenotyping : a process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this process may include special staining of the blood cells. it is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.    -  t-cell receptor (tcr) gene rearrangement test: a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked to see if there is a certain change in the genes. this gene change can lead to too many of one kind of t-cells (white blood cells that fight infection) to be made.    -   flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample of blood, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light."
what is (are) fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ?,"fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (fop) is a disorder in which muscle tissue and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified), forming bone outside the skeleton (extra-skeletal or heterotopic bone) that constrains movement. this process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and proceeding down the body and into the limbs.  extra-skeletal bone formation causes progressive loss of mobility as the joints become affected. inability to fully open the mouth may cause difficulty in speaking and eating. over time, people with this disorder may experience malnutrition due to their eating problems. they may also have breathing difficulties as a result of extra bone formation around the rib cage that restricts expansion of the lungs.  any trauma to the muscles of an individual with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, such as a fall or invasive medical procedures, may trigger episodes of muscle swelling and inflammation (myositis) followed by more rapid ossification in the injured area. flare-ups may also be caused by viral illnesses such as influenza.  people with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are generally born with malformed big toes. this abnormality of the big toes is a characteristic feature that helps to distinguish this disorder from other bone and muscle problems. affected individuals may also have short thumbs and other skeletal abnormalities."

how to diagnose madelung disease ?,"how is madelung disease diagnosed? madelung disease is usually diagnosed based on a thorough physical exam, accurate medical history, and imaging studies - computed tomography (ct scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (mri scan). a ct scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an mri scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the lipomas and surrounding tissues. both of these tests are useful in establishing a diagnosis of madelung disease, although mri is often the preferred method. in some cases, a biopsy of the lipomas may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
is pseudocholinesterase deficiency inherited ?,"when due to genetic causes, this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder have one copy of the altered gene in each cell and are called carriers. they can pass on the gene mutation to their children, but they do not usually experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. in some cases, carriers of bche gene mutations take longer than usual to clear choline ester drugs from the body, but not as long as those with two copies of the altered gene in each cell."
is noonan syndrome inherited ?,"how is noonan syndrome inherited? noonan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition. each child of a person with noonan syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the condition. in some cases, the condition is inherited from an affected parent. because the features of the condition can vary and may be very subtle, many affected adults are diagnosed only after the birth of a more obviously affected infant. in other cases, the condition is caused by a new mutation occurring for the first time in the affected person."
what are the treatments for hashimoto's encephalitis ?,"how might hashimoto's encephalitis be treated? medical management of hashimoto's encephalitis (he) usually involves corticosteroids and treatment of thyroid abnormalities (if present). the optimal dose of oral steroids is not known. most patients with he respond to steroid therapy. symptoms typically improve or resolve over a few months. decisions regarding the length of steroid treatment and the rate of tapering off steroids are based on the individual's response to treatment. treatment may last as long as two years in some patients. people with he who experience repeated he relapses, do not respond to steroids, and/or cannot tolerate steroid treatment have been treated with other immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have also been used."
is hashimoto's syndrome inherited ?,"is hashimoto's syndrome inherited? the inheritance pattern of hashimoto's syndrome is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. however, the condition can cluster in families, and having a close relative with hashimoto's syndrome or another autoimmune disorder likely increases a person's risk of developing the condition."
what is (are) bowen-conradi syndrome ?,"bowen-conradi syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body and is usually fatal in infancy. affected individuals have a low birth weight, experience feeding problems, and grow very slowly. their head is unusually small overall (microcephaly), but is longer than expected compared with its width (dolichocephaly). characteristic facial features include a prominent, high-bridged nose and an unusually small jaw (micrognathia) and chin. affected individuals typically have pinky fingers that are curved toward or away from the ring finger (fifth finger clinodactyly) or permanently flexed (camptodactyly), feet with soles that are rounded outward (rocker-bottom feet), and restricted joint movement.  other features that occur in some affected individuals include seizures; structural abnormalities of the kidneys, heart, brain, or other organs; and an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). affected males may have the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) or undescended testes (cryptorchidism).  babies with bowen-conradi syndrome do not achieve developmental milestones such as smiling or sitting, and they usually do not survive more than 6 months."

is prader-willi syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of prader-willi syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the paternal chromosome 15 or by maternal uniparental disomy. these genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  rarely, a genetic change responsible for prader-willi syndrome can be inherited. for example, it is possible for a genetic change that abnormally inactivates genes on the paternal chromosome 15 to be passed from one generation to the next."
is renal tubular dysgenesis inherited ?,"renal tubular dysgenesis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the affected gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how to diagnose parasites - leishmaniasis ?,"various laboratory methods can be used to diagnose leishmaniasis—to detect the parasite as well as to identify the leishmania species (type). some of the methods are available only in reference laboratories. in the united states, cdc staff can assist with the testing for leishmaniasis.
    
tissue specimens—such as from skin sores (for cutaneous leishmaniasis) or from bone marrow (for visceral leishmaniasis)—can be examined for the parasite under a microscope, in special cultures, and in other ways. blood tests that detect antibody (an immune response) to the parasite can be helpful for cases of visceral leishmaniasis; tests to look for the parasite itself usually also are done.

"what are the symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?","what are the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type? bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent teeth. infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. in severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. the x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. the ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition. the symptoms seen in autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia are typically more severe than those seen in the autosomal dominant form. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the metaphyses 90% craniofacial hyperostosis 90% depressed nasal bridge 90% hypertelorism 90% increased bone mineral density 90% wide nasal bridge 90% skeletal dysplasia 50% telecanthus 50% conductive hearing impairment 7.5% facial palsy 7.5% sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% visual impairment 7.5% abnormality of the nasopharynx - abnormality of the thorax - autosomal recessive inheritance - bony paranasal bossing - broad alveolar ridges - club-shaped distal femur - coarse facial features - delayed eruption of permanent teeth - facial hyperostosis - flared metaphysis - macrocephaly - mandibular prognathia - metaphyseal dysplasia - mixed hearing impairment - nasal obstruction - optic atrophy - patchy sclerosis of finger phalanx - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what causes rh incompatibility ?,"a difference in blood type between a pregnant woman and her baby causes rh incompatibility. the condition occurs if a woman is rh-negative and her baby is rh-positive.
                
when you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. if you're rh-negative and your baby is rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.
                
your body will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's rh-positive blood. these antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. this can lead to hemolytic anemia in the baby.
                
rh incompatibility usually doesn't cause problems during a first pregnancy. the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop.
                
however, once you've formed rh antibodies, they remain in your body. thus, the condition is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is rh-positive).
                
with each pregnancy, your body continues to make rh antibodies. as a result, each rh-positive baby you conceive becomes more at risk for serious problems, such as severe hemolytic anemia."
what causes adiposis dolorosa ?,"what causes adiposis dolorosa? the exact cause of adiposis dolorosa remains unknown. while possible causes have been suggested, none have been confirmed. these include long-term treatment with high-dose corticosteroids; endocrine system abnormalities; and changes in fatty acid or carbohydrate metabolism. researchers have also suggested that it could be an autoimmune disorder. because the condition has rarely occurred in more than one person within a family, it may have a genetic component. however, no specific gene known to be associated with the condition has been identified. it is unknown why adiposis dolorosa usually occurs in people who are overweight or obese, or why the signs and symptoms do not appear until mid-adulthood."
what are the treatments for tabes dorsalis ?,"penicillin, administered intravenously, is the treatment of choice. associated pain can be treated with opiates, valproate, or carbamazepine. patients may also require physical or rehabilitative therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with tabes dorsalis is important."
what is (are) colon cancer ?,"key points
                    - colon cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon.    - health history affects the risk of developing colon cancer.    - signs of colon cancer include blood in the stool or a change in bowel habits.    - tests that examine the colon and rectum are used to detect (find) and diagnose colon cancer.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    colon cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon.
                    the colon is part of the bodys digestive system. the digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. the digestive system is made up of the esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. the colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are about 6-8 inches long. the anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).      gastrointestinal stromal tumors can occur in the colon. see the pdq summary on gastrointestinal stromal tumors treatment for more information.    see the pdq summary about unusual cancers of childhood treatment for information about colorectal cancer in children."

what is the outlook for batten disease ?,"over time, affected children suffer cognitive impairment, worsening seizures, and progressive loss of sight and motor skills. eventually, children with batten disease become blind, bedridden, and demented. batten disease is often fatal by the late teens or twenties."
is situs inversus inherited ?,"is situs inversus inherited? the genetics of situs inversus is complex. several familial cases have been reported in which the inheritance has been described as either autosomal recessive (most commonly), autosomal dominant, or x-linked. the condition appears to be genetically heterogeneous, meaning that different genetic factors or genes may cause the condition among different people or families. if situs inversus is associated with another underlying syndrome or condition, the inheritance pattern may be the same as that of the underlying condition. people with questions about genetic risks to themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional."
what are the symptoms of primary gastrointestinal melanoma ?,"what are the symptoms of primary melanoma of the small intestine? symptoms of primary melanoma of the small intestine can vary from person to person. symptoms tend to be non-specific including nausea, vomiting, stomachache, fatigue, hemorrhage (broken blood vessels), and anemia (low red blood cell count)."
what are the genetic changes related to pdgfrb-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia ?,"pdgfrb-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is caused by genetic rearrangements that join part of the pdgfrb gene with part of another gene. at least 20 genes have been found that fuse with the pdgfrb gene to cause pdgfrb-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. the most common genetic abnormality in this condition results from a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material that brings part of the pdgfrb gene on chromosome 5 together with part of the etv6 gene on chromosome 12, creating the etv6-pdgfrb fusion gene.  the pdgfrb gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in turning on (activating) signaling pathways that control many cell processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation). the etv6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns off (represses) gene activity. this protein is important in development before birth and in regulating blood cell formation. the protein produced from the etv6-pdgfrb fusion gene, called etv6/pdgfr, functions differently than the proteins normally produced from the individual genes. like the normal pdgfr protein, the etv6/pdgfr fusion protein turns on signaling pathways. however, the fusion protein does not need to be turned on to be active, so the signaling pathways are constantly turned on (constitutively activated). the fusion protein is unable to repress gene activity regulated by the normal etv6 protein, so gene activity is increased. the constitutively active signaling pathways and abnormal gene activity increase the proliferation and survival of cells.  when the etv6-pdgfrb fusion gene mutation occurs in cells that develop into blood cells, the growth of eosinophils (and occasionally other blood cells, such as neutrophils and mast cells) is poorly controlled, leading to pdgfrb-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. it is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change."
what are the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis ?,"the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) might be related to dvt itself or pulmonary embolism (pe). see your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of either condition. both dvt and pe can cause serious, possibly life-threatening problems if not treated.
                
deep vein thrombosis
                
only about half of the people who have dvt have signs and symptoms. these signs and symptoms occur in the leg affected by the deep vein clot. they include:
                
swelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg
                
pain or tenderness in the leg, which you may feel only when standing or walking
                
increased warmth in the area of the leg that's swollen or painful
                
red or discolored skin on the leg
                
pulmonary embolism

what to do for urinary incontinence in children ?,"- urinary incontinence (ui) is the loss of bladder control, which results in the accidental loss of urine. a child with ui may not stay dry during the day or night. although ui affects many children, it usually disappears naturally over time.  - by 5 years of age, more than 98 percent of children can control urination during the day. nighttime wetting is more common than daytime wetting in children, affecting 30 percent of 4-year-olds.  - the exact cause of most cases of nighttime ui is not known. though a few cases are caused by structural problems in the urinary tract, most cases result from more than one factor including slower physical development, an overproduction of urine at night, and the inability to recognize bladder filling when asleep.  - nighttime ui has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), obstructive sleep apnea (osa), and anxiety. certain genes have been found to contribute to ui.  - daytime ui that is not associated with urinary tract infection (uti) or structural problems in the urinary tract may be due to an overactive bladder or infrequent or incomplete voiding problems.  - most ui fades away naturally as a child grows and develops and does not require treatment. when treatment is needed, options include bladder training and related strategies, moisture alarms, and medications."
what is (are) vici syndrome ?,"vici syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by agenesis (failure to develop) of the corpus callosum, cataracts , hypopigmentation of the eyes and hair, cardiomyopathy, and combined immunodeficiency. hearing loss, seizures, and delayed motor development have also been reported. swallowing and feeding difficulties early on may result in a failure to thrive. recurrent infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts are common. vici syndrome is caused by mutations in the epg5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is mainly supportive."
what are the genetic changes related to autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ?,"mutations in the lgi1 gene cause adpeaf. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called lgi1 or epitempin, which is found primarily in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. although researchers have proposed several functions for this protein, its precise role in the brain remains uncertain.  mutations in the lgi1 gene likely disrupt the function of epitempin. it is unclear how the altered protein leads to seizure activity in the brain.  lgi1 mutations have been identified in about half of all families diagnosed with adpeaf. in the remaining families, the cause of the condition is unknown. researchers are searching for other genetic changes that may underlie the condition."
what are the treatments for myotonia congenita ?,"most people with myotonia congenita dont require special treatments. stiff muscles usually resolve with exercise, or light movement, especially after resting. for individuals whose symptoms are more limiting, doctors have had some success with medications such as quinine, or anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin. physical therapy and other rehabilitative therapies are also sometimes used to improve muscle function."
do you have information about hormones,"summary : hormones are your body's chemical messengers. they travel in your bloodstream to tissues or organs. they work slowly, over time, and affect many different processes, including       - growth and development    - metabolism - how your body gets energy from the foods you eat    -  sexual function    -  reproduction    -  mood       endocrine glands, which are special groups of cells, make hormones. the major endocrine glands are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas. in addition, men produce hormones in their testes and women produce them in their ovaries.     hormones are powerful. it takes only a tiny amount to cause big changes in cells or even your whole body. that is why too much or too little of a certain hormone can be serious. laboratory tests can measure the hormone levels in your blood, urine, or saliva. your health care provider may perform these tests if you have symptoms of a hormone disorder. home pregnancy tests are similar - they test for pregnancy hormones in your urine."
what is (are) megalencephaly ?,"megalencephaly, also called macrencephaly, is a condition in which an infant or child has an abnormally large, heavy, and usually malfunctioning brain. by definition, the brain weight is greater than average for the age and gender of the child. head enlargement may be evident at birth or the head may become abnormally large in the early years of life. megalencephaly is thought to be related to a disturbance in the regulation of cell production in the brain. in normal development, neuron proliferation - the process in which nerve cells divide to form new generations of cells - is regulated so that the correct number of cells is produced in the proper place at the appropriate time. in a megalencephalic brain, too many cells are produced either during development or progressively as part of another disorder, such as one of the neurofibromatoses or leukodystrophies. symptoms of megalencephaly include delayed development, seizures, and corticospinal (brain cortex and spinal cord) dysfunction. megalencephaly affects males more often than females. unilateral megalencephaly or hemimegalencephaly is a rare condition that is characterized by the enlargement of one side of the brain. children with this disorder may have a large, asymmetrical head accompanied by seizures, partial paralysis, and impaired cognitive development. megalencephaly is different from macrocephaly (also called megacephaly or megalocephaly), which describes a big head, and which doesnt necessarily indicate abnormality. large head size is passed down through the generations in some families."
what are the genetic changes related to corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency ?,"mutations in the serpina6 gene cause corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency. the serpina6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called corticosteroid-binding globulin (cbg), which is primarily produced in the liver. the cbg protein attaches (binds) to a hormone called cortisol. this hormone has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. when cortisol is bound to cbg, the hormone is turned off (inactive). normally, around 80 to 90 percent of the body's cortisol is bound to cbg. when cortisol is needed in the body, cbg delivers the cortisol where it is needed and releases it, causing cortisol to become active. in this manner, cbg regulates the amount of cortisol that is available for use in the body. the amount of total cortisol in the body consists of both bound (inactive) and unbound (active) cortisol.  serpina6 gene mutations often decrease the cbg protein's ability to bind to cortisol; some severe mutations prevent the production of any cbg protein. with less functional cbg to bind cortisol, people with corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency usually have increased unbound cortisol levels. typically, the body decreases cortisol production to compensate, resulting in a reduction in total cortisol.  it is unclear how a decrease in cbg protein and total cortisol leads to the signs and symptoms of corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency. since the cbg protein is needed to transport cortisol to specific tissues at certain times, it may be that while cortisol is available in the body, the cortisol is not getting to the tissues that require it. a decrease in cortisol may influence widening or narrowing of the blood vessels, contributing to abnormal blood pressure. some researchers think the features of the disorder may influence each other and that fatigue could be a result of chronic pain rather than a symptom of the disorder itself. there may also be other genetic or environmental factors that influence whether an affected individual is more likely to develop pain or fatigue."
what is (are) klippel feil syndrome ?,"klippel feil syndrome (kfs) is a congenital, musculoskeletal condition characterized by the fusion of at least two vertebrae of the neck. common symptoms include a short neck, low hairline at the back of the head, and restricted mobility of the upper spine. this condition can cause chronic headaches as well as pain in both the neck and the back. other features may involve various other body parts or systems. sometimes, kfs occurs as a feature of another disorder or syndrome, such as wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia. in these cases, affected people have the features of both kfs and the additional disorder. kfs may be caused by mutations in the gdf6 or gdf3 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; or, it may be caused by mutations in the meox1 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is symptomatic and may include medications, surgery, and/or physical therapy."
what are the genetic changes related to majeed syndrome ?,"majeed syndrome results from mutations in the lpin2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called lipin-2. researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats (lipid metabolism). however, no lipid abnormalities have been found with majeed syndrome. lipin-2 also may be involved in controlling inflammation and in cell division.  mutations in the lpin2 gene alter the structure and function of lipin-2. it is unclear how these genetic changes lead to bone disease, anemia, and inflammation of the skin in people with majeed syndrome."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for cerebral aneurysms ?,the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) conducts research in its laboratories at the national institutes of health (nih) and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions. the ninds supports a broad range of basic and clinical research on intracranial aneurysms and other vascular lesions of the nervous system. the familial intracranial aneurysm study seeks to identify possible genes that may increase the risk of development of aneurysms in blood vessels in the brain. other research projects include genome-wide studies to identify genes or dna sequences that may indicate families harboring one type of aneurysm may be at increased risk of another type; studies of chromosomes to identify aneurysm-related genes; and additional research on microsurgical clipping and endovascular surgery to treat various types of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.
who is at risk for gestational trophoblastic disease? ?,age and a previous molar pregnancy affect the risk of gtd. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for gtd include the following:         - being pregnant when you are younger than 20 or older than 35 years of age.     - having a personal history of hydatidiform mole.

what are the treatments for hidradenocarcinoma ?,"how might hidradenocarcinoma be treated? because hidradenocarcinoma is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  treatment is determined by the size and location of each particular cancer and the extent to which cancer cells may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or tissues.  surgery is often the first step and aims to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  both a traditional surgical technique, known as wide local excision, and the newer mohs micrographic surgery have been used to remove hidradenocarcinomas.  radiation therapy, performed by a doctor known as radiation oncologist, has been used after surgery in patients with hidradenocarcinoma to destroy any cancer cells that may remain at the original location of the tumor or in the lymph nodes.  chemotherapy, performed by a doctor known as a medical oncologist, has not yet been proven as effective treatment for hidradenocarcinomas."
what is (are) tempi syndrome ?,"tempi syndrome is a newly discovered, multisystem condition named for 5 characteristics that affected individuals have: telangiectasias, erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin level, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric-fluid collections (fluid around the kidney), and intrapulmonary shunting (when a region of the lungs is supplied with blood but with little or no ventilation). signs and symptoms of tempi syndrome have appeared in mid-adulthood in all known affected individuals. the telangiectasias develop mostly on the face, trunk and arms. the intrapulmonary shunt causes hypoxia (not enough oxygen supply), which slowly progresses until the person needs continuous supplemental oxygen to support their breathing. blood clots and bleeding in the brain have also been reported in some affected individuals. the cause of tempi syndrome is currently unknown. treatment has reportedly been completely or partially successful with the medication bortezomib."
what is (are) darier disease ?,"darier disease is a skin condition characterized by wart-like blemishes on the body. the blemishes are usually yellowish in color, hard to the touch, mildly greasy, and can emit a strong odor. the most common sites for blemishes are the scalp, forehead, upper arms, chest, back, knees, elbows, and behind the ear. the mucous membranes can also be affected, with blemishes on the roof of the mouth (palate), tongue, inside of the cheek, gums, and throat. other features of darier disease include nail abnormalities, such as red and white streaks in the nails with an irregular texture, and small pits in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  the wart-like blemishes characteristic of darier disease usually appear in late childhood to early adulthood. the severity of the disease varies over time; affected people experience flare-ups alternating with periods when they have fewer blemishes. the appearance of the blemishes is influenced by environmental factors. most people with darier disease will develop more blemishes during the summertime when they are exposed to heat and humidity. uv light; minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching; and ingestion of certain medications can also cause an increase in blemishes.  on occasion, people with darier disease may have neurological disorders such as mild intellectual disability, epilepsy, and depression. learning and behavior difficulties have also been reported in people with darier disease. researchers do not know if these conditions, which are common in the general population, are associated with the genetic changes that cause darier disease, or if they are coincidental. some researchers believe that behavioral problems might be linked to the social stigma experienced by people with numerous skin blemishes.  a form of darier disease known as the linear or segmental form is characterized by blemishes on localized areas of the skin. the blemishes are not as widespread as they are in typical darier disease. some people with the linear form of this condition have the nail abnormalities that are seen in people with classic darier disease, but these abnormalities occur only on one side of the body."
what is (are) high blood pressure and kidney disease ?,"blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls as the heart pumps out blood, and high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the body. factors that can increase this force include higher blood volume due to extra fluid in the blood and blood vessels that are narrow, stiff, or clogged.
                
blood pressure test results are written with two numbers separated by a slash. for example, a health care provider will write a blood pressure result as 120/80. a health care provider will say this blood pressure result as 120 over 80. the top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. the bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats.
                
most people without chronic health conditions have a normal blood pressure if it stays below 120/80. prehypertension is a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 89. high blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 140 or above or a diastolic pressure of 90 or above.1
                
people should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked."
what is (are) osteopetrosis autosomal recessive 2 ?,"osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage (fracture). researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked. the different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. mutations in at least nine genes cause the various types of osteopetrosis."

what are the treatments for familial mediterranean fever ?,"how might familial mediterranean fever (fmf) be treated? currently, there is no known cure for fmf. physicians can only treat the symptoms of the disease. a common therapy for fmf is daily use of the drug colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation. many people require colchicine for life. this therapy has been successful in preventing attacks of fever in 75 percent of those who take the drug regularly. over 90 percent of people with fmf demonstrate a marked improvement. even if colchicine does not prevent the fever attacks, it does prevent the amyloidosis. however, compliance in taking colchicine every day is very important. if a person stops taking the drug, an attack can occur within a few days. complications of colchicine use can also occur and include muscle weakness (myopathy) and a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like reaction. since the gene that causes fmf codes for the protein pyrin, researchers hope that by studying how this protein works they will ultimately develop improved treatments for fmf, and possibly for other conditions involving excess inflammation."

                    after a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal (gi) tract or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).     -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. for example, if a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually gist cells. the disease is metastatic gist, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    the results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment.
                    for many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment. however, the treatment of gist is not based on the stage of the cancer. treatment is based on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread to other parts of the abdomen or to distant parts of the body.    treatment is based on whether the tumor is:         -  resectable: these tumors can be removed by surgery .    -  unresectable: these tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery.    -  metastatic and recurrent: metastatic tumors have spread to other parts of the body. recurrent tumors have recurred (come back) after treatment. recurrent gists may come back in the gastrointestinal tract or in other parts of the body. they are usually found in the abdomen, peritoneum, and/or liver.    -  refractory: these tumors have not gotten better with treatment."
what is (are) pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"pityriasis rubra pilaris (prp) refers to a group of skin conditions that cause constant inflammation and scaling of the skin. affected people have reddish-orange colored patches; they may occur everywhere on the body or only on certain areas. there are several types of prp, which are classified based on age of onset, body areas affected, and whether other associated conditions are present. prp is usually sporadic (occurring randomly) but some forms may be inherited."

what is (are) combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria ?,"combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (cmamma) is a condition characterized by high levels of certain chemicals, known as malonic acid and methylmalonic acid, in the body. a distinguishing feature of this condition is higher levels of methylmalonic acid than malonic acid in the urine, although both are elevated.  the signs and symptoms of cmamma can begin in childhood. in some children, the buildup of acids causes the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis), which can damage the body's tissues and organs. other signs and symptoms may include involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and coma. some affected children have an unusually small head size (microcephaly).  other people with cmamma do not develop signs and symptoms until adulthood. these individuals usually have neurological problems, such as seizures, loss of memory, a decline in thinking ability, or psychiatric diseases."
what are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis ?,"medication, exercise, and, in some cases, surgery are common treatments for this disease. most people who have rheumatoid arthritis take medications. some drugs only provide relief for pain; others reduce inflammation. people with rheumatoid arthritis can also benefit from exercise, but they need to maintain a good balance between rest and exercise. they should get rest when the disease is active and get more exercise when it is not. in some cases, a doctor will recommend surgery to restore function or relieve pain in a damaged joint. several types of surgery are available to patients with severe joint damage. joint replacement and tendon reconstruction are examples."
who is at risk for insomnia? ?,"insomnia is a common disorder. it affects women more often than men. the disorder can occur at any age. however, older adults are more likely to have insomnia than younger people.

what is (are) subcortical band heterotopia ?,"subcortical band heterotopia, also known as double cortex syndrome, is a condition of abnormal brain development that is present from birth.  this condition which primarily affects females, occurs when neurons migrate to an area of the brain where they are not supposed to be (heterotopia), and form abnormal areas that appear as band-like clusters of white tissue underneath the gray tissue of the cerebral cortex (subcortical), creating the appearance of a double cortex. symptoms associated with subcortical band heterotopia vary from severe intellectual disability and epilepsy to normal intelligence with mild or no epilepsy. subcortical band heterotopia is most often caused by mutations in the dcx gene. the condition is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. some cases may be caused by a small deletion on chromosome 17 involving the lis1 gene. management consists of seizure control."
how to diagnose transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter ?,"tests that examine the abdomen and kidneys are used to detect (find) and diagnose transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter. the following tests and procedures may be used:          -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   urinalysis : a test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria.    -   ureteroscopy : a procedure to look inside the ureter and renal pelvis to check for abnormal areas. a ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. the ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. a tool may be inserted through the ureteroscope to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.    -   urine cytology : a laboratory test in which a sample of urine is checked under a microscope for abnormal cells. cancer in the kidney, bladder, or ureter may shed cancer cells into the urine.    -   intravenous pyelogram (ivp): a series of x-rays of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder to check for cancer. a contrast dye is injected into a vein. as the contrast dye moves through the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages.    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   ultrasound : a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. an ultrasound of the abdomen may be done to help diagnose cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. this may be done during a ureteroscopy or surgery."
what is (are) aplastic anemia ?,"aplastic anemia is a rare but serious blood disorder. if you have it, your bone marrow doesn't make enough new blood cells. causes include       - toxic substances, such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene    - radiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancer    - certain medicines    - infections such as hepatitis, epstein-barr virus, or hiv    - autoimmune disorders    - certain inherited conditions    - pregnancy       in many people, the cause is unknown.    symptoms include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and shortness of breath. it can cause heart problems such as an irregular heartbeat, an enlarged heart, and heart failure. you may also have frequent infections and bleeding.    your doctor will diagnose aplastic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you. treatments include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"
what is (are) autoimmune atrophic gastritis ?,"autoimmune atrophic gastritis is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells of the stomach lining. overtime, this can wear away the stomach's protective barrier and interfere with the absorption of several key vitamins (i.e. vitamin b12, iron, folate). in some cases, autoimmune atrophic gastritis does not cause any obvious signs and symptoms. however, some people may experience nausea, vomiting, a feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen after eating, abdominal pain and/or vitamin deficiencies. the condition is associated with an increased risk of pernicious anemia, gastric polyps and gastric adenocarcinoma. although the underlying genetic cause has not been identified, studies suggest that the condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in some families. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person, but may include vitamin b12 injections and endoscopic surveillance."

what is (are) neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 ?,"neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 (cln10-ncl) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. signs and symptoms of the condition can develop any time from birth to adulthood and may include progressive dementia, seizures, lack of muscle coordination, and vision loss. cln10-ncl is caused by changes (mutations) in the ctsd gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment options are limited to therapies that can help relieve some of the symptoms."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for colorectal cancer ?,"researchers continue to look at new ways to treat, diagnose, and prevent colorectal cancer. many are testing other types of treatments in clinical trials. advances in treatments studies have found that patients who took the drug avastin, a targeted chemotherapy drug, with their standard chemotherapy treatment had a longer progression-free survival than those who did not take avastin, but some studies have indicated that avastin does not extend life. (the generic name for avastin is bevacizumab.) scientists are also working on vaccines therapies and monoclonal antibodies that may improve how patients' immune systems respond to colorectal cancers. monoclonal antibodies are a single type of antibody that researchers make in large amounts in a laboratory. surgical techniques have reduced the number of patients needing a permanent colostomy. a colostomy is an opening made in the abdomen for waste to pass out of the body before it reaches the rectum. in many cases, the surgeon can reconnect the healthy parts of the colon back together after removing the cancer. this way, the colon can function just as it did before. the plco trial the national cancer institute's prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial, or plco trial, recently provided results about the role of sigmoidoscopy in reducing deaths from colon and rectal cancers. the plco trial, involving 148,000 volunteers aged 55 to 74, compared two groups of people over a 10-year period and found that the group that received sigmoidoscopies had fewer deaths from colorectal cancer than those who did not get a sigmoidoscopy. nsaids and polyp formation preventing colorectal cancer is a concern of many researchers. studies have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can keep large-bowel polyps from forming. bowel polyps can start out benign, or non-cancerous, but can become cancerous. however, the effects that these drugs have on the heart and other parts of the body is of concern, therefore these drugs should only be used for prevention under a doctor's supervision. genetic research genes involved in colorectal cancer continue to be identified and understood. hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or hnpcc, is one condition that causes people in a certain family to develop colorectal cancer at a young age. the discovery of four genes involved with this disease has provided crucial clues about the role of dna repair in colorectal and other cancers. scientists are continuing to identify genes associated with colon cancers that run in families. using traditional screening methods on people from families that carry these genes may be another way to identify cancers at an early stage and cut deaths from colorectal cancer. genetic screening of people at high risk may become more common in the near future besides looking at genes in families, researchers in the the cancer genome atlas study looked at the genes of actual colon tumors to better understand the contribution that genes make to cancer. by looking at the genetic composition of the tumor, researchers were able to identify new mutations (changes) in the genes that can lead to cancer, including the genes braf and egrf."
what are the treatments for narcolepsy ?,"there is no cure for narcolepsy. in 1999, after successful clinical trial results, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved a drug called modafinil for the treatment of eds. two classes of antidepressant drugs have proved effective in controlling cataplexy in many patients: tricyclics (including imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, and protriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (including fluoxetine and sertraline). drug therapy should be supplemented by behavioral strategies. for example, many people with narcolepsy take short, regularly scheduled naps at times when they tend to feel sleepiest. improving the quality of nighttime sleep can combat eds and help relieve persistent feelings of fatigue. among the most important common-sense measures people with narcolepsy can take to enhance sleep quality are actions such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages before bedtime. the drug xyrem (sodium oxybate or gamma hydroxybutyrate, also known as ghb) was approved in july 2002 for treating cataplexy and in november 2005 for eds in people who have narcolepsy. due to safety concerns associated with the use of this drug, the distribution of xyrem is tightly restricted."

what causes antisynthetase syndrome ?,"what causes antisynthetase syndrome? the exact underlying cause of antisynthetase syndrome is currently unknown. however, it is considered an autoimmune disease. autoimmune disorders occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. in antisynthetase syndrome, specifically, the production of autoantibodies (antibodies that attack normal cells instead of disease-causing agents) that recognize and attack certain enzymes in the body called 'aminoacyl-trna synthetases' appears to be linked to the cause of the syndrome. aminoacyl-trna synthetases are involved in protein synthesis within the body. the exact role of autoantibodies in causation of antisynthetase syndrome is not yet known."
is joubert syndrome inherited ?,"joubert syndrome typically has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they usually do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  rare cases of joubert syndrome are inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. in these cases, the causative gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

how to prevent balance problems ?,"people are more likely to have problems with balance as they get older. but age is not the only reason these problems occur; there are other causes, too. in some cases, you can help reduce your risk for certain balance problems. problems in the inner ear some balance disorders are caused by problems in the inner ear. the part of the inner ear that is responsible for balance is the vestibular system, also known as the labyrinth. when the labyrinth becomes infected or swollen, this condition is called labyrinthitis. it is typically accompanied by vertigo and imbalance. upper respiratory infections and other viral infections, and, less commonly, bacterial infections, can lead to labyrinthitis. other causes other balance diseorers may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. for example, diseases of the circulatory system, such as stroke, can cause dizziness and other balance problems. smoking and diabetes can increase the risk of stroke. low blood pressure can also cause dizziness. aging, infections, head injury and many medicines may also result in a balance problem. problems caused by medications balance problems can also result from taking many medications. for example, some medicines, such as those that help lower blood pressure, can make a person feel dizzy. ototoxic drugs are medicines that damage the inner ear. if your medicine is ototoxic, you may feel off balance. sometimes the damage lasts only as long as you take the drug; many times it is permanent. groups of drugs that are more likely to be ototoxic include -  antidepressants  - anti-seizure drugs (anticonvulsants)  -  hypertensive (high blood pressure) drugs  - sedatives  - tranquilizers  -  anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs)   - aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic)   - diuretics  - vasodilators  - certain analgesics (painkillers)  - certain chemotherapeutics (anti-cancer drugs). antidepressants anti-seizure drugs (anticonvulsants) hypertensive (high blood pressure) drugs sedatives tranquilizers anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs) aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic) diuretics vasodilators certain analgesics (painkillers) certain chemotherapeutics (anti-cancer drugs). check with your doctor if you notice a problem while taking a medication. ask if other medications can be used instead. if not, ask if the dosage can be safely reduced. sometimes it cannot. however, your doctor will help you get the medication you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. diet and lifestyle can help your diet and lifestyle can help you manage certain balance-related problems. for example, mnire's disease, which causes vertigo and other balance and hearing problems, is linked to a change in the volume of fluid in the inner ear. by eating low-salt (low-sodium) or salt-free foods, and steering clear of caffeine and alcohol, you may make mnire's disease symptoms less severe. see suggestions for limiting salt (sodium) in your diet. balance problems due to high blood pressure can be managed by eating less salt (less sodium), maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising. balance problems due to low blood pressure may be managed by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, avoiding alcohol, and being cautious regarding your body's posture and movement, such as standing up slowly and avoiding crossing your legs when youre seated. learn more about managing high blood pressure (hypertension). learn more about manging low blood pressure (hypotension). prevent ear infections the ear infection called otitis media is common in children, but adults can get it too. otitis media can sometimes cause dizziness. you can help prevent otitis media by washing your hands frequently. also, talk to your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot to stave off flu-related ear infections. if you still get an ear infection, see a doctor immediately before it becomes more serious. learn more about otitis media and other ear infections.

how to prevent kidney disease of diabetes ?,"blood pressure medicines
                
scientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure. in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb, a diuretic can also be useful. beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed.
                
an example of an effective ace inhibitor is lisinopril (prinivil, zestril), which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes. the benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure: it may directly protect the kidneys' glomeruli. ace inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure.
                
an example of an effective arb is losartan (cozaar), which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events.
                
patients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines.
                
moderate-protein diets
                
in people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein, but avoid high-protein diets. for people with greatly reduced kidney function, a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure. anyone following a reduced-protein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition.
                
intensive management of blood glucose
                
antihypertensive drugs and low-protein diets can slow ckd. a third treatment, known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control, has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of ckd.
                
the human body normally converts food to glucose, the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body's cells. to enter cells, glucose needs the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. when a person does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present, the body cannot process glucose, and it builds up in the bloodstream. high levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes.
                
intensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal. the regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently, administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity, following a diet and activity plan, and consulting a health care team regularly. some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day.
                
a number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose. in the diabetes control and complications trial supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk), researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels. the intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliterabout 80 milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients. the united kingdom prospective diabetes study, conducted from 1976 to 1997, showed conclusively that, in people with improved blood glucose control, the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third. additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of ckd."

what are the genetic changes related to smith-magenis syndrome ?,"most people with smith-magenis syndrome have a deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 17. although this region contains multiple genes, researchers believe that the loss of one particular gene, rai1, in each cell is responsible for most of the characteristic features of this condition. the loss of other genes in the deleted region may help explain why the features of smith-magenis syndrome vary among affected individuals.  a small percentage of people with smith-magenis syndrome have a mutation in the rai1 gene instead of a chromosomal deletion. although these individuals have many of the major features of the condition, they are less likely than people with a chromosomal deletion to have short stature, hearing loss, and heart or kidney abnormalities.  the rai1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. mutations in one copy of this gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the rai1 protein or reduce the amount of this protein that is produced in cells. researchers are uncertain how changes in this protein result in the physical, mental, and behavioral problems associated with smith-magenis syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause ehlers-danlos syndrome. the classical type results most often from mutations in either the col5a1 gene or the col5a2 gene. mutations in the tnxb gene have been found in a very small percentage of cases of the hypermobility type (although in most cases, the cause of this type is unknown). the vascular type results from mutations in the col3a1 gene. plod1 gene mutations cause the kyphoscoliosis type. mutations in the col1a1 gene or the col1a2 gene result in the arthrochalasia type. the dermatosparaxis type is caused by mutations in the adamts2 gene. the other, less well-characterized forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome result from mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.  some of the genes associated with ehlers-danlos syndrome, including col1a1, col1a2, col3a1, col5a1, and col5a2, provide instructions for making pieces of several different types of collagen. these pieces assemble to form mature collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. other genes, including adamts2, plod1, and tnxb, provide instructions for making proteins that process or interact with collagen. mutations that cause the different forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome disrupt the production or processing of collagen, preventing these molecules from being assembled properly. these defects weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, and other parts of the body, resulting in the characteristic features of this condition."
what is (are) cohen syndrome ?,"cohen syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects many parts of the body and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, small head size (microcephaly), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). other features include progressive nearsightedness (myopia), degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal dystrophy), an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), and distinctive facial features. characteristic facial features include thick hair and eyebrows, long eyelashes, unusually-shaped eyes (down-slanting and wave-shaped), a bulbous nasal tip, a smooth or shortened area between the nose and the upper lip (philtrum), and prominent upper central teeth. the combination of the last two facial features results in an open-mouth appearance.  the features of cohen syndrome vary widely among affected individuals. additional signs and symptoms in some individuals with this disorder include low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), overly friendly behavior, and obesity that develops in late childhood or adolescence. when obesity is present, it typically develops around the torso, with the arms and legs remaining slender. individuals with cohen syndrome may also have narrow hands and feet, and slender fingers."
what is the outlook for whiplash ?,"generally, prognosis for individuals with whiplash is good. the neck and head pain clears within a few days or weeks. most patients recover within 3 months after the injury, however, some may continue to have residual neck pain and headaches."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome ?,"patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
is diastrophic dysplasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer ?,"key points
                    - after nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - the following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer:         - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i     - stage ii     - stage iii     - stage iv
                
                
                    after nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. the results of the tests used to diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (see the general information section.)
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. the disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer:
                    stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the nasopharynx. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       stage i    in stage i, cancer has formed and the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only; or     - has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity.           the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils.        stage ii    in stage ii nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity. cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      -  is found in the parapharyngeal space. cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.            the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. the parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.       stage iii     in stage iii nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity. cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      - is found in the parapharyngeal space. cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      - has spread to nearby bones or sinuses. cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.            the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. the parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.       stage iv     stage iv nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into stages iva, ivb, and ivc.            -  stage iva: cancer has spread beyond the nasopharynx and may have spread to the cranial nerves, the hypopharynx (bottom part of the throat), areas in and around the side of the skull or jawbone, and/or the bone around the eye. cancer may also have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. the affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.     -  stage ivb: cancer has spread to lymph nodes between the collarbone and the top of the shoulder and/or the affected lymph nodes are larger than 6 centimeters.      -  stage ivc: cancer has spread beyond nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body."
what is (are) femoral facial syndrome ?,"femoral-facial syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment of the thigh bones and certain facial features, which may include upslanting eyes, short nose with a broad tip, long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), thin upper lip, small or underdeveloped lower jaw (micrognathia), and cleft palate. symptoms may affect one or both sides of the face and limbs. cleft palate has been reported only in females. other signs and symptoms occur variably. intellectual development has been reported as normal. in most cases the cause of the condition is unknown (sporadic). some cases have been reported in association with diabetes during pregnancy (maternal diabetes). there have been rare reports (three cases) describing a family with more than one affected member."
what are the treatments for breast cancer ?,"there are many treatment options for women with breast cancer. the choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the stage of the cancer, whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, and other factors. if tests show that you have cancer, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible. studies show that early treatment leads to better outcomes. working with a team of specialists people with cancer often are treated by a team of specialists. the team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient's progress. the team may include a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, a surgeon, a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy, and others. before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. some insurance companies require a second opinion. others may pay for a second opinion if you request it. (watch the video about this breast cancer survivor's treatment. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) clinical trials for breast cancer some breast cancer patients take part in studies of new treatments. these studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is both safe and effective. often, clinical trials compare a new treatment with a standard one so that doctors can learn which is more effective. women with breast cancer who are interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk to their doctor. the u.s. national institutes of health, through its national library of medicine and other institutes, maintains a database of clinical trials at clinicaltrials.gov. see a list of the current clinical trials on breast cancer."
what is (are) chancroid ?,"chancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact. it is caused by a type of bacteria called haemophilus ducreyi. chancroid is characterized by a small bump on the genital which becomes a painful ulcer. men may have just one ulcer, but women often develop four or more. about half of the people who are infected with a chancroid will develop enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen. in some cases, the nodes will break through the skin and cause draining abscesses. the swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are often called buboes. chancroid infections can be treated with antibiotics, including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. large lymph node swellings need to be drained, either with a needle or local surgery."
what are the treatments for cyclic vomiting syndrome ?,"a health care provider may refer patients to a gastroenterologist for treatment.
                
people with cyclic vomiting syndrome should get plenty of rest and take medications to prevent a vomiting episode, stop an episode in progress, speed up recovery, or relieve associated symptoms.
                
the health care team tailors treatment to the symptoms experienced during each of the four cyclic vomiting syndrome phases:
                
- prodrome phase treatment. the goal during the prodrome phase is to stop an episode before it progresses. taking medication early in the phase can help stop an episode from moving to the vomiting phase or becoming severe; however, people do not always realize an episode is coming. for example, a person may wake up in the morning and begin vomiting. a health care provider may recommend the following medications for both children and adults:      - ondansetron (zofran) or lorazepam (ativan) for nausea    - ibuprofen for abdominal pain    - ranitidine (zantac), lansoprazole (prevacid), or omeprazole (prilosec, zegerid) to control stomach acid production    - sumatriptan (imitrex)prescribed as a nasal spray, an injection, or a pill that dissolves under the tonguefor migraines    - vomiting phase treatment. once vomiting begins, people should call or see a health care provider as soon as possible. treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and sleep in a dark, quiet room. a health care provider may recommend the following for both children and adults:      - medication for pain, nausea, and reducing stomach acid and anxiety    - anti-migraine medications such as sumatriptan to stop symptoms of a migraine or possibly stop an episode in progress    - hospitalization for severe nausea and vomiting    - iv fluids and medications to prevent dehydration and treat symptoms    - iv nutrition if an episode continues for several days    - recovery phase treatment. during the recovery phase, drinking and eating will replace lost electrolytes. a person may need iv fluids for a period of time. some people find their appetite returns to normal right away, while others start by drinking clear liquids and then moving slowly to other liquids and solid food. a health care provider may prescribe medications during the recovery phase and well phase to prevent future episodes.  - well phase treatment. during the well phase, a health care provider may use medications to treat people whose episodes are frequent and long lasting in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes. a person may need to take a medication daily for 1 to 2 months before evaluating whether it helps prevent episodes. a health care provider may prescribe the following medications for both children and adults during the well phase to prevent cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes, lessen their severity, and reduce their frequency:      - amitriptyline (elavil)    - propranolol (inderal)    - cyproheptadine (periactin)"
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for encephaloceles ?,the ninds conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. the knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and offers hope for new means to treat and prevent congenital brain disorders including neural tube defects such as encephaloceles.
is intestinal pseudo-obstruction inherited ?,"intestinal pseudo-obstruction is often not inherited. when it does run in families, it can have different inheritance patterns.  intestinal pseudo-obstruction caused by flna gene mutations is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the flna gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  intestinal pseudo-obstruction can also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in other families it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. when intestinal pseudo-obstruction is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown.  when intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a feature of mngie disease, it is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial dna (mtdna). because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children.  in some cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown."
what are the treatments for what i need to know about kidney failure and how its treated ?,"the treatments for kidney failure are
                
- hemodialysis  - peritoneal dialysis  - a kidney transplant  - conservative management"
what is (are) chronic fatigue syndrome ?,"chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease, is a condition that causes extreme, long-lasting fatigue which can limit the ability to participate in ordinary, daily activities.  it generally occurs in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 and is twice as common in women. the main symptom is disabling fatigue that does not improve with rest. other signs and symptoms may include muscle pain; joint pain; concentration and memory problems; headaches; sleep problems; fever; sore throat; and/or tender lymph nodes. the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome is not known yet. some researchers have proposed that this condition is caused by viral infections or by immunological, hormonal or mental or psychiatric problems, but none have been proved. it is also believed that there may be a genetic predisposition for this condition and stress-related events act as triggers. because the symptoms are similar to many conditions that need to be ruled out, the diagnosis make take some time to be made and patients are frequently misunderstood. those who are affected are typically highly functioning individuals who are ""struck down"" with this disease. there is still no cure for this condition but there are several clinical trials. current treatment consists of cognitive and/or behavioral therapy and focuses on improving symptoms and may include medications to treat pain, sleep disorders and other associated problems. there is significant controversy and debate in the medical literature about the relationship between myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome. unfortunately there is no consensus on nomenclature or classification for these disorders, and different countries, organizations, and researchers continue to use different names to describe these conditions. until a global consensus is reached on how to name and classify these disorders, confusion will persist."
what are the genetic changes related to tetrasomy 18p ?,"tetrasomy 18p results from the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome, called an isochromosome 18p, in each cell. an isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms. isochromosome 18p is a version of chromosome 18 made up of two p arms.  cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. in people with tetrasomy 18p, cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18 plus an isochromosome 18p. as a result, each cell has four copies of the short arm of chromosome 18. (the word ""tetrasomy"" is derived from ""tetra,"" the greek word for ""four."") the extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder."
what is (are) mccune-albright syndrome ?,"mccune-albright syndrome is a disorder that affects the bones, skin, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues.  people with mccune-albright syndrome develop areas of abnormal scar-like (fibrous) tissue in their bones, a condition called polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. polyostotic means the abnormal areas (lesions) may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. when lesions occur in the bones of the skull and jaw it can result in uneven (asymmetric) growth of the face. asymmetry may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may also occur. bone lesions may become cancerous, but this happens in fewer than 1 percent of people with mccune-albright syndrome.  in addition to bone abnormalities, affected individuals usually have light brown patches of skin called caf-au-lait spots, which may be present from birth. the irregular borders of the caf-au-lait spots in mccune-albright syndrome are often compared to a map of the coast of maine. by contrast, caf-au-lait spots in other disorders have smooth borders, which are compared to the coast of california. like the bone lesions, the caf-au-lait spots in mccune-albright syndrome often appear on only one side of the body.  girls with mccune-albright syndrome usually reach puberty early. these girls usually have menstrual bleeding by age two, many years before secondary sex characteristics such as breast enlargement and pubic hair are evident. this early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, a female sex hormone, produced by cysts that develop in one of the ovaries. less commonly, boys with mccune-albright syndrome may also experience early puberty.  other endocrine problems may also occur in people with mccune-albright syndrome. the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck, may become enlarged (a condition called a goiter) or develop masses called nodules. about 50 percent of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. the pituitary gland (a structure at the base of the brain that makes several hormones) may produce too much growth hormone. excess growth hormone can result in acromegaly, a condition characterized by large hands and feet, arthritis, and distinctive facial features that are often described as ""coarse."" rarely, affected individuals develop cushing's syndrome, an excess of the hormone cortisol produced by the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. cushing's syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems."
what is (are) factor v leiden thrombophilia ?,"factor v leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. factor v leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation that results in thrombophilia, which is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots that can block blood vessels.  people with factor v leiden thrombophilia have a higher than average risk of developing a type of blood clot called a deep venous thrombosis (dvt). dvts occur most often in the legs, although they can also occur in other parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys. factor v leiden thrombophilia also increases the risk that clots will break away from their original site and travel through the bloodstream. these clots can lodge in the lungs, where they are known as pulmonary emboli. although factor v leiden thrombophilia increases the risk of blood clots, only about 10 percent of individuals with the factor v leiden mutation ever develop abnormal clots.  the factor v leiden mutation is associated with a slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage). women with this mutation are two to three times more likely to have multiple (recurrent) miscarriages or a pregnancy loss during the second or third trimester. some research suggests that the factor v leiden mutation may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), slow fetal growth, and early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption). however, the association between the factor v leiden mutation and these complications has not been confirmed. most women with factor v leiden thrombophilia have normal pregnancies."
how to diagnose langerhans cell histiocytosis ?,"the following tests and procedures may be used to detect (find) and diagnose lch or conditions caused by lch:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   neurological exam : a series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. the exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. this may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   complete blood count (cbc) with differential : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      -  the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.       - the number and type of white blood cells.      - the number of red blood cells and platelets.             -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the body by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   liver function test : a blood test to measure the blood levels of certain substances released by the liver. a high or low level of these substances can be a sign of disease in the liver.    -   braf gene testing : a laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for mutations of the braf gene.    -   urinalysis : a test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.     -   water deprivation test : a test to check how much urine is made and whether it becomes concentrated when little or no water is given. this test is used to diagnose diabetes insipidus, which may be caused by lch.    -   bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of lch.  the following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed:               -  immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.       -  flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, how many cells are live, and the size of the cells. it also shows the shapes of the cells and whether there are tumor markers on the surface of the cells. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light.              -   bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.     -   x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. sometimes a skeletal survey is done. this is a procedure to x-ray all of the bones in the body.    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. a substance called gadolinium may be injected into a vein. the gadolinium collects around the lch cells so that they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   bronchoscopy : a procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. a bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. a bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   endoscopy : a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. an endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.    -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for lch cells. to diagnose lch, a biopsy of bone lesions, skin, lymph nodes, or the liver may be done."
what causes ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"what causes ehlers-danlos syndrome? ehlers-danlos syndrome can be caused by changes (mutations) in several different genes (col5a1, col5a2, col1a1, col3a1, tnxb, plod1, col1a2, and adamts2). however, the underlying genetic cause is unknown in some families. mutations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, and/or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. a defect in collagen can weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs resulting in the features of the disorder."
how to diagnose primary gastrointestinal melanoma ?,"how might primary melanoma of the small intestine be diagnosed? a variety of tests may be involved in the initial diagnosis of the tumor, including contrast radiography, endoscopy, and ct scan. the tumor is confirmed by surgical resection. careful study of tissue samples from the tumor under a microscope will show the same immunohistochemical characteristics of skin melanomas. once this has been established, the following are proposed diagnostic criteria for primary melanoma of the small intestine: 1. the absence of a previous or synchronously resected melanoma or atypical melanocytic lesion of the skin. 2. the absence of metastatic spread to other organs. 3. the presence of intramucosal lesions of the overlying or adjacent intestinal mucosa."
what is (are) cushing's syndrome ?,"cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. sometimes called hypercortisolism, cushing's syndrome is relatively rare and most commonly affects adults aged 20 to 50. people who are obese and have type 2 diabetes, along with poorly controlled blood glucose-also called blood sugar-and high blood pressure, have an increased risk of developing the disorder."
what is (are) fg syndrome ?,"fg syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body and occurs almost exclusively in males. ""fg"" represents the surname initials of the first family diagnosed with the disorder.  fg syndrome affects intelligence and behavior. almost everyone with the condition has intellectual disability, which ranges from mild to severe. affected individuals tend to be friendly, inquisitive, and hyperactive, with a short attention span. compared to people with other forms of intellectual disability, their socialization and daily living skills are strong, while verbal communication and language skills tend to be weaker.  the physical features of fg syndrome include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), broad thumbs, and wide first (big) toes. abnormalities of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum) are also common. most affected individuals have constipation, and many have abnormalities of the anus such as an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus). people with fg syndrome also tend to have a distinctive facial appearance including small, underdeveloped ears; a tall, prominent forehead; and outside corners of the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures).  additional features seen in some people with fg syndrome include widely set eyes (hypertelorism), an upswept frontal hairline, and a large head compared to body size (relative macrocephaly). other health problems have also been reported, including heart defects, seizures, undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in males, and a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (an inguinal hernia)."
is tietze syndrome inherited ?,is tietze syndrome inherited? tietze syndrome is not thought to be inherited. most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition.
what are the treatments for autoimmune atrophic gastritis ?,"how might autoimmune atrophic gastritis be treated? the treatment of autoimmune atrophic gastritis is generally focused on preventing and/or alleviating signs and symptoms of the condition. for example, management is focused on preventing vitamin b12, folate and iron deficiencies in the early stages of the condition. with adequate supplementation of these vitamins and minerals, anemia and other health problems may be avoided. if pernicious anemia is already present at the time of diagnosis, replacement of vitamin b12 is generally recommended via injections. in some cases, endoscopic surveillance may also be recommended due to the increased risk of certain types of cancer. while surgery may be appropriate for the treatment of related cancers, we are not aware of surgical management options or recommendations otherwise. symptoms of gastritis in general may be managed with prescription or over-the-counter medications (besides antibiotics for h. pylori-associated gastritis) that block or reduce acid production and promote healing. proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. examples may include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole and pantoprazole. histamine (h-2) blockers reduce the amount of acid released into the digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and promotes healing. examples include ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine and nizatidine. antacids that neutralize stomach acid and provide pain relief may also be used. we are not aware of dietary guidelines or recommendations for autoimmune atrophic gastritis. much of the literature on dietary management of gastritis is specific to h. pylori-associated gastritis. however, people with gastritis in general may find some relief by eating smaller, more-frequent meals; avoiding irritating foods; avoiding alcohol; switching pain relievers; and managing stress."

                    the following are risk factors for breast cancer:
                    older age    older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. the chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.        a personal history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease    women with any of the following have an increased risk of breast cancer:            - a personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis), or lobular carcinoma in situ (lcis).     - a personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.              inherited risk of breast cancer    women with a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) have an increased risk of breast cancer.    women who have inherited changes in the  brca1  and  brca2  genes or in certain other genes have a higher risk of breast cancer. the risk of breast cancer caused by inherited gene changes depends on the type of gene mutation, family history of cancer, and other factors.        dense breasts    having breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram is a factor in breast cancer risk. the level of risk depends on how dense the breast tissue is. women with very dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with low breast density.    increased breast density is often an inherited trait, but it may also occur in women who have not had children, have a first pregnancy late in life, take postmenopausal hormones, or drink alcohol.       exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body     estrogen is a hormone made by the body. it helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. being exposed to estrogen over a long time may increase the risk of breast cancer. estrogen levels are highest during the years a woman is menstruating.     a woman's exposure to estrogen is increased in the following ways:            -  early menstruation: beginning to have menstrual periods at age 11 or younger increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  starting menopause at a later age: the more years a woman menstruates, the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  older age at first birth or never having given birth: because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, breast tissue is exposed to more estrogen in women who become pregnant for the first time after age 35 or who never become pregnant.              taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause     hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, can be made into a pill form in a laboratory. estrogen, progestin, or both may be given to replace the estrogen no longer made by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women who have had their ovaries removed. this is called hormone replacement therapy (hrt) or hormone therapy (ht). combination hrt/ht is estrogen combined with progestin. this type of hrt/ht increases the risk of breast cancer. studies show that when women stop taking estrogen combined with progestin, the risk of breast cancer decreases.       radiation therapy to the breast or chest     radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, starting 10 years after treatment. the risk of breast cancer depends on the dose of radiation and the age at which it is given. the risk is highest if radiation treatment was used during puberty, when breasts are forming.     radiation therapy to treat cancer in one breast does not appear to increase the risk of cancer in the other breast.    for women who have inherited changes in the brca1 and brca2 genes, exposure to radiation, such as that from chest x-rays, may further increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in women who were x-rayed before 20 years of age.       obesity     obesity increases the risk of breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy.       drinking alcohol     drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. the level of risk rises as the amount of alcohol consumed rises.
                
                
                    the following are protective factors for breast cancer:
                    less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body    decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help prevent breast cancer. exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways:            -   early pregnancy: estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy. women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35.     -  breast-feeding: estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breast-feeding. women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed.              taking estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators       estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy     hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy. in these women, estrogen-only therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer. there is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy.          selective estrogen receptor modulators      tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms). serms act like estrogen on some tissues in the body, but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues.     treatment with tamoxifen lowers the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (er-positive) breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at high risk. treatment with raloxifene also lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. with either drug, the reduced risk lasts for several years or longer after treatment is stopped. lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene.      taking tamoxifen increases the risk of hot flashes, endometrial cancer, stroke, cataracts, and blood clots (especially in the lungs and legs). the risk of having these problems increases markedly in women older than 50 years compared with younger women. women younger than 50 years who have a high risk of breast cancer may benefit the most from taking tamoxifen. the risk of having these problems decreases after tamoxifen is stopped. talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.      taking raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots in the lungs and legs, but does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (decreased bone density), raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer for women who have a high or low risk of breast cancer. it is not known if raloxifene would have the same effect in women who do not have osteoporosis. talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.     other serms are being studied in clinical trials.          aromatase inhibitors and inactivators      aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) and inactivators (exemestane) lower the risk of recurrence and of new breast cancers in women who have a history of breast cancer. aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women with the following conditions:                -  postmenopausal women with a personal history of breast cancer.      -  women with no personal history of breast cancer who are 60 years and older, have a history of ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy, or have a high risk of breast cancer based on the gail model tool (a tool used to estimate the risk of breast cancer).               in women with an increased risk of breast cancer, taking aromatase inhibitors decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body. before menopause, estrogen is made by the ovaries and other tissues in a woman's body, including the brain, fat tissue, and skin. after menopause, the ovaries stop making estrogen, but the other tissues do not. aromatase inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called aromatase, which is used to make all of the body's estrogen. aromatase inactivators stop the enzyme from working.     possible harms from taking aromatase inhibitors include muscle and joint pain, osteoporosis, hot flashes, and feeling very tired.           risk-reducing mastectomy     some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing mastectomy (the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer). the risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer. however, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision.       ovarian ablation    the ovaries make most of the estrogen that is made by the body. treatments that stop or lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries include surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs. this is called ovarian ablation.    premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the brca1 and brca2 genes may choose to have a risk-reducing oophorectomy (the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer). this decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer. risk-reducing oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest. however, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision. the sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin. these include hot flashes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and depression. long-term effects include decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, and decreased bone density.        getting enough exercise    women who exercise four or more hours a week have a lower risk of breast cancer. the effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in premenopausal women who have normal or low body weight.
                
                
                    it is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer:
                    oral contraceptives    certain oral contraceptives contain estrogen. some studies have shown that taking oral contraceptives (""the pill"") may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users. this risk decreases over time. other studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who take oral contraceptives.     progestin -only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. more studies are needed to know whether progestin-only oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer.       environment    studies have not proven that being exposed to certain substances in the environment, such as chemicals, increases the risk of breast cancer.
                
                
                    studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer.
                    the following do not affect the risk of breast cancer:            - having an abortion.     - making diet changes such as eating less fat or more fruits and vegetables.     - taking vitamins, including fenretinide (a type of vitamin a).     -  cigarette smoking, both active and passive (inhaling secondhand smoke).     -  using underarm deodorant or antiperspirant.     - taking statins (cholesterol -lowering drugs).     - taking bisphosphonates (drugs used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia) by mouth or by intravenous infusion."

what are the treatments for osteoarthritis ?,"treatment goals: manage pain, improve function osteoarthritis treatment plans often include ways to manage pain and improve function. such plans can include exercise, rest and joint care, pain relief, weight control, medicines, surgery, and non-traditional treatment approaches. current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability, but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis. exercise: one of the best treatments exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis. it can improve mood and outlook, decrease pain, increase flexibility, and help you maintain a healthy weight. the amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved, how stable the joints are, whether or not the joint is swollen, and whether a joint replacement has already been done. ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you the following types of exercise are part of a well-rounded arthritis treatment plan. -  strengthening exercises.  these exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. they can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance.  - aerobic activities.  these are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape.   -  range-of-motion activities.  these keep your joints limber.  - balance and agility exercises.  these help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling.   strengthening exercises.  these exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. they can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance. aerobic activities.  these are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape.  range-of-motion activities.  these keep your joints limber. balance and agility exercises.  these help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling. to see examples of exercises for older adults, see  exercises to try or visit go4life,  the national institute on agings exercise and physical activity program for older adults. weight control if you are overweight or obese, you should try to lose weight. weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints, limit further injury, increase mobility, and reduce the risk of associated health problems. a dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits. a healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight. rest and relief from stress on joints treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest. you must learn to recognize the bodys signals, and know when to stop or slow down. this will prevent the pain caused by overexertion. although pain can make it difficult to sleep, getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain. if you have trouble sleeping, you may find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback can help. timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help. if joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest, consult your doctor. some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints. they may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and/ or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity. splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness. if you need a splint, an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one. non-drug pain relief and alternative therapies people with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain. below are some examples. - heat and cold. heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. in some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area.

massage.  in this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. this may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. however, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease.  massage.  in this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. this may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. however, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease. -  acupuncture.  some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. a large study supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) and the national center for complementary and alternative medicine (nccam) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care.  acupuncture.  some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. a large study supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) and the national center for complementary and alternative medicine (nccam) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care. - nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been reported to improve the symptoms of people with osteoarthritis, as have certain vitamins. additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. it is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been reported to improve the symptoms of people with osteoarthritis, as have certain vitamins. additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. it is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. - folk remedies. these include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing wd-40 on joints to lubricate them. although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. they can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. folk remedies. these include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing wd-40 on joints to lubricate them. although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. they can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. for general information on alternative therapies, see the complementary health approaches topic. medications doctors consider a number of factors when choosing medicines for their patients. in particular, they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs. for pain relief, doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal. if acetaminophen does not relieve pain, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used. some nsaids are available over the counter, while more than a dozen others, including a subclass called cox-2 inhibitors, are available only with a prescription. other medications, including corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and topical creams are also used. reduce the risks of nsaid use most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects, so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take. for example, people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or nsaids, with caution. there are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with nsaids. these include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. in some cases, it may help to take another medication along with an nsaid to coat the stomach or block stomach acids. although these measures may help, they are not always completely effective. for more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects, see side effects  in the taking medicines topic. surgery for many people, surgery helps relieve the pain and disability of osteoarthritis. surgery may be performed to achieve one or more of the following goals. - removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement).  - repositioning of bones (osteotomy).  - resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). repositioning of bones (osteotomy). resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). joint replacement surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses. these joints can be made from metal alloys, high-density plastic, and ceramic material. some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements. others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface (a process called biologic fixation) to hold them in place. artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer. surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight, sex, age, activity level, and other medical conditions. joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability, in some cases, to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint, leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact, and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible. for more on joint replacement see the hip replacement and knee replacement topics. deciding on surgery the decision to use surgery depends on several factors, including the patients age, occupation, level of disability, pain intensity, and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle. after surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily."
what is (are) achondrogenesis type 2 ?,"achondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that are present from birth and affect the development of cartilage and bone. infants with achondrogenesis usually have a small body, short arms and legs, and other skeletal abnormalities that cause life-threatening complications.  there are at least three forms of achondrogenesis, type 1a, type 1b and type 2, which are distinguished by signs and symptoms, pattern of inheritance, and the results of imaging studies such as x-rays (radiology), tissue analysis (histology), and genetic testing.  type 1a and 1b achondrogenesis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  type 1b may be caused by mutations in the slc26a2 gene.  type 2 achondrogenesis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by new (de novo) mutations in the col2a1 gene."
what are the symptoms of multifocal motor neuropathy ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of multifocal motor neuropathy? signs and symptoms of multifocal motor neuropathy (mmn) may include weakness; cramping; involuntary contractions or twitching; and wasting (atrophy) of affected muscles. atrophy occurs late in the course of the condition. muscles of the hands and lower arms are most commonly affected, but muscles of the lower limbs may also be involved. the symptoms are often asymmetrical, meaning that they differ on the right and left side of the body."
is wolf-hirschhorn syndrome inherited ?,"between 85 and 90 percent of all cases of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome are not inherited. they result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. more complex chromosomal rearrangements can also occur as de novo events, which may help explain the variability in the condition's signs and symptoms. de novo chromosomal changes occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  a small percentage of all people with wolf-hirschhorn syndrome have the disorder as a result of an unusual chromosomal abnormality such as a ring chromosome 4. ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure. in the process, genes near the ends of the chromosome are lost.  in the remaining cases of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome, an affected individual inherits a copy of chromosome 4 with a deleted segment. in these cases, one of the individual's parents carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosome 4 and another chromosome. this rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. no genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. however, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. some people with wolf-hirschhorn syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation that deletes genes near the end of the short arm of chromosome 4. a loss of these genes results in the intellectual disability, slow growth, and other health problems characteristic of this disorder."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for gerstmann's syndrome ?,the ninds supports research on disorders that result from damage to the brain such as dysgraphia. the ninds and other components of the national institutes of health also support research on learning disabilities. current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and treat learning disabilities and increase understanding of the biological basis of them.
what are the treatments for pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"how might pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency be treated? treatment of pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) deficiency rarely influences the course of the disease, but goals include stimulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdhc), providing alternative sources of energy, and preventing immediate, acute worsening of the condition. however, even with treatment, damage to the central nervous system is common. lactic acid accumulation may be lessened by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet, but this does not alleviate the neurological symptoms, because structural damage in the brain is typically present from before birth. there is some evidence that a medication called dichloroacetate may reduce the metabolic issues in some patients. the standard of care is to supplement cofactors, which are substances in the body that help the chemical reactions in the cells to occur; these include thiamine, carnitine, and lipoic acid. the individuals with pdh deficiency that respond to these cofactors (especially thiamine) usually have a better outcome. however, giving all of these cofactors to all patients with pdh deficiency is typical in order to optimize pyruvate dehydrogenase complex function. oral citrate is often used to treat acidosis."
what is (are) head lice ?,"head lice are parasitic wingless insects. they live on people's heads and feed on their blood. an adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed. the eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a knot in thread. lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.    lice spread by close person-to-person contact. it is possible, but not common, to get lice by sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. personal hygiene has nothing to do with getting head lice. head lice do not spread disease.    symptoms are        - tickling feeling in the hair    - frequent itching    - sores from scratching    - irritability and difficulty sleeping. head lice are most active in the dark.       treatment is recommended for people who have an active infestation of head lice. all household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. some experts also recommend treating anyone who shares a bed with an infested person. it is important to treat everyone at the same time.    centers for disease control and prevention"

what is (are) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. white blood cells help your body fight infection. your blood cells form in your bone marrow. in leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. these cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), there are too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.    cll is the second most common type of leukemia in adults. it often occurs during or after middle age, and is rare in children.    usually cll does not cause any symptoms. if you have symptoms, they may include       - painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin    - fatigue    - pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    - fever and infection    - weight loss       tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes diagnose cll. your doctor may choose to just monitor you until symptoms appear or change. treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery to remove the spleen, and targeted therapy. targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    nih: national cancer institute"
what are the treatments for varicose veins ?,"varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. the goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.
                
if varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. if your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. for example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins.
                
some people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look.
                
although treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming.
                
lifestyle changes
                
lifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. these changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. lifestyle changes include the following:
                
avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. when sitting, avoid crossing your legs. keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. when you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.
                
do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. this helps blood move through your veins.
                
if you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. this will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
                
avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.
                
avoid wearing high heels for long periods. lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. toned muscles help blood move through the veins.
                
your doctor may recommend compression stockings. these stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. this pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs.
                
there are three types of compression stockings. one type is support pantyhose. these offer the least amount of pressure. a second type is over-the-counter compression hose. these stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.
                
prescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. these stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. they also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. however, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person.
                
medical procedures
                
medical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins.
                
you may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain.
                
the side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-ga-shun). rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring.
                
sclerotherapy
                
sclerotherapy (skler-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. the chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. the irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away.
                
this procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. it can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. you may need several treatments to completely close off a vein.
                
treatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling.
                
microsclerotherapy
                
microsclerotherapy (mi-kro-skler-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins.
                
a small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. the chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off.
                
laser surgery
                
this procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. the laser light makes the vein fade away.
                
laser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. no cutting or injection of chemicals is involved.
                
endovenous ablation therapy
                
endovenous ablation (ab-la-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein.
                
your doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. he or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. a device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off.
                
you'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. you usually can go home the same day as the procedure.
                
endoscopic vein surgery
                
for endoscopic (en-do-skop-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. he or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. a surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein.
                
endoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). after the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks.
                
ambulatory phlebectomy
                
for ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-bek-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. this procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin.
                
you'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done.
                
vein stripping and ligation
                
vein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. the procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin.
                
you'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure.
                
vein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. the recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks."

what are the genetic changes related to alpha thalassemia ?,"alpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the hba1 and hba2 genes. both of these genes provide instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin, which is a component (subunit) of hemoglobin.  people have two copies of the hba1 gene and two copies of the hba2 gene in each cell. each copy is called an allele. for each gene, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother. as a result, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin. the different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles.  hb bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss of all four alpha-globin alleles. hbh disease is caused by a loss of three of the four alpha-globin alleles. in these two conditions, a shortage of alpha-globin prevents cells from making normal hemoglobin. instead, cells produce abnormal forms of hemoglobin called hemoglobin bart (hb bart) or hemoglobin h (hbh). these abnormal hemoglobin molecules cannot effectively carry oxygen to the body's tissues. the substitution of hb bart or hbh for normal hemoglobin causes anemia and the other serious health problems associated with alpha thalassemia.  two additional variants of alpha thalassemia are related to a reduced amount of alpha-globin. because cells still produce some normal hemoglobin, these variants tend to cause few or no health problems. a loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles results in alpha thalassemia trait. people with alpha thalassemia trait may have unusually small, pale red blood cells and mild anemia. a loss of one alpha-globin allele is found in alpha thalassemia silent carriers. these individuals typically have no thalassemia-related signs or symptoms."
what is (are) macular degeneration ?,"macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (amd), is a leading cause of vision loss in americans 60 and older. it is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. you need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     amd affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. it does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. there are two types: wet and dry. wet amd happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. these new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. wet amd damages the macula quickly. blurred vision is a common early symptom. dry amd happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. your gradually lose your central vision. a common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. treatment can slow vision loss. it does not restore vision.    nih: national eye institute"
how to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?,"how is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diagnosed? nash is usually first suspected when elevations are noted in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels. these may include alanine aminotransferase (alt) or aspartate aminotransferase (ast). when further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x-rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, nash is suspected. the only way to definitely diagnosis nash and separate it from simple fatty liver is through a liver biopsy. for a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. nash is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. if the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or nafld is diagnosed. an important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. blood tests and scans cannot reliably provide this information at this time."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for pseudotumor cerebri ?,"the ninds conducts and supports research on disorders of the brain and nervous system, including pseudotumor cerebri. this research focuses primarily on increasing scientific understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
what are the treatments for migraine ?,"there is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood. there are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes. drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine. botulinum toxin a has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine. behaviorally, stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, biofeedback mechanisms, and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort, may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks. making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes, including dietary considerations, eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration, stopping certain medications, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule. hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. a weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine.
                
relief of symptoms, or acute treatments, during attacks consists of sumatriptan, ergotamine drugs, and analgesics such as ibuprofen and aspirin. the sooner these treatments are administered, the more effective they are."
how many people are affected by congenital mirror movement disorder ?,congenital mirror movement disorder is a very rare disorder. its prevalence is thought to be less than 1 in 1 million. researchers suggest that some mildly affected individuals may never be diagnosed.
how to diagnose pyruvate kinase deficiency ?,is genetic testing available for pyruvate kinase deficiency? yes. genetests lists laboratories offering clinical genetic testing for this condition. clinical genetic tests are ordered to help diagnose an affected person or other family members and to aid in decisions regarding medical care or reproductive issues. we recommend that you talk to your health care provider or a genetic professional to learn more about your testing options.
what are the treatments for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ?,how might dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (drpla) be treated? there is no cure for drpla; treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. management of signs and symptoms may include:  treatment of seizures with anti-epileptic drugs treatment of psychiatric problems with appropriate psychotropic medications adaptation of environment and care to the level of dementia adaptation of educational programs for affected children.
how many people are affected by neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease ?,nomid is a very rare disorder; approximately 100 affected individuals have been reported worldwide.
what are the treatments for vesicoureteral reflux ?,"the standard treatment for primary vur has included prompt treatment of utis and long-term use of antibiotics to prevent utis, also called antimicrobial prophylaxis, until vur goes away on its own. antibiotics are bacteria-fighting medications. surgery has also been used in certain cases.
                
several studies have raised questions about long-term use of antibiotics for prevention of utis. the studies found little or no effect on prevention of kidney damage. long-term use may also make the child resistant to the antibiotic, meaning the medication does not work as well, and the child may be sicker longer and may need to take medications that are even stronger.
                
- children younger than 1 year of age continuous antibiotics should be used if a child has a history of febrile uti or vur grade iii through v that was identified through screening  - children older than 1 year of age with bbdcontinuous antibiotics should be used while bbd is being treated  - children older than 1 year of age without bbdcontinuous antibiotics can be used at the discretion of the health care provider but is not automatically recommended; however, utis should be promptly treated
                
deflux, a gellike liquid containing complex sugars, is an alternative to surgery for treatment of vur. a small amount of deflux is injected into the bladder wall near the opening of the ureter. this injection creates a bulge in the tissue that makes it harder for urine to flow back up the ureter. the health care provider uses a special tube to see inside the bladder during the procedure. deflux injection is an outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia, so the child can go home the same day."
how to diagnose national hormone and pituitary program (nhpp): information for people treated with pituitary human growth hormone (comprehensive report) ?,"cjd is usually diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of the illness, how severe they are, and how quickly they become worse. however, doctors must study brain tissue from a biopsy or autopsy in order to make a definite diagnosis of cjd.
                
other tests can suggest cjd. in 1996, researchers developed a test that helps doctors diagnose cjd in patients with symptoms. this test detects an abnormal protein in a sample of spinal fluid. when this protein is found, it helps make a diagnosis of cjd. it is much easier and safer to take a sample of spinal fluid than to do a brain biopsy. unfortunately, this test cannot identify cjd in patients who do not have symptoms. the test cannot predict who may develop cjd in the future.
                
researchers from many countries, including the united states, have reported success using mri to diagnose cjd and vcjd in people with symptoms of the disease. mri is a safe and painless tool that allows doctors to look at images of the brain and does not involve the collection of brain or spinal fluid samples."
what is (are) fuchs endothelial dystrophy ?,"fuchs endothelial dystrophy is a condition that causes vision problems. the first symptom of this condition is typically blurred vision in the morning that usually clears during the day. over time, affected individuals lose the ability to see details (visual acuity). people with fuchs endothelial dystrophy also become sensitive to bright lights.  fuchs endothelial dystrophy specifically affects the front surface of the eye called the cornea. deposits called guttae, which are detectable during an eye exam, form in the middle of the cornea and eventually spread. these guttae contribute to the loss of cells in the cornea, leading to vision problems. tiny blisters may develop on the cornea, which can burst and cause eye pain.  the signs and symptoms of fuchs endothelial dystrophy usually begin in a person's forties or fifties. a very rare early-onset variant of this condition starts to affect vision in a person's twenties."
what are the treatments for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,"how is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome treated? because postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots) is thought to have a variety of causes, there is no single treatment that is effective for all people with the condition. in general, management of pots aims to relieve low blood volume and/or regulate circulatory problems that could be causing the condition. in some affected people, simple life style interventions such as adding extra salt to the diet, ensuring adequate fluid intake, participating in a specialized exercise program, and avoiding factors that exacerbate the condition appear to improve symptoms. certain medications have also been used to treat pots with some success."

what are the treatments for pars planitis ?,"how might pars planitis be treated? the first approach to treating pars planitis is corticosteroid eye drops or injections near the eye to control inflammation. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, including aspirin) or steroid medications (such as prednisone) can be taken by mouth. if these strategies are not successful, other medications may be given to reduce the body's immune response (medications called immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate).  if medications are not effective, surgery may be considered. cryotherapy has been performed in affected people to remove eye tissue that has inflammation. although this surgery has been shown to be effective in restoring clarity of vision, there are concerns that it may cause damage to other parts of the eye. another surgery, known as vitrectomy, can be done to remove cloudy fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye."
what are the treatments for klinefelter syndrome ?,"how might klinefelter syndrome be treated? because symptoms of klinefelter syndrome (ks) can sometimes be very mild, many people are never diagnosed or treated. when a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. this may include: educational interventions - as children, many people with klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. therapeutic options - a variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. medical management - about half of people with ks have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair. many healthcare providers recommend testosterone therapy when a boy reaches puberty. however, not all males with ks benefit from testosterone therapy. some affected people may opt to have breast removal or reduction surgery. the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development's web site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of klinefelter syndrome. please click on the link to access this resource."

what is (are) striatonigral degeneration ?,"striatonigral degeneration is a neurological disorder caused by a disruption in the connection between two areas of the brain-the striatum and the substantia nigra. these two areas work together to enable balance and movement. striatonigral degeneration is a type of multiple system atrophy (msa). symptoms of the disorder resemble some of those seen in parkinson's disease, including rigidity, instability, impaired speech, and slow movements."
who is at risk for merkel cell carcinoma? ?,"un exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of merkel cell carcinoma. anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for merkel cell carcinoma include the following:         - being exposed to a lot of natural sunlight.    - being exposed to artificial sunlight, such as from tanning beds or psoralen and ultraviolet a (puva) therapy for psoriasis.    -  having an immune system weakened by disease, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or hiv infection.     - taking drugs that make the immune system less active, such as after an organ transplant.    -  having a history of other types of cancer.    - being older than 50 years, male, or white."
what is the outlook for canavan disease ?,"the prognosis for canavan disease is poor. death usually occurs before age 10, although some children may survive into their teens and twenties."
what is (are) tremor ?,"tremor is an unintentional, rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. most tremors occur in the hands, although they can also affect the arms, head, face, voice, trunk, and legs. sometimes tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder or a side effect of certain drugs, but the most common form occurs in otherwise healthy people. some forms of tremor are inherited and run in families, while others have no known cause. excessive alcohol consumption or alcohol withdrawal can kill certain nerve cells, resulting in tremor, especially in the hand. other causes include an overactive thyroid and the use of certain drugs. tremor may occur at any age but is most common in middle-aged and older persons.
                
there are several forms of tremor, including:
                
essential tremor (sometimes called benign essential tremor) is the most common form of abnormal tremor.the hands are most often affected but the head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk may also be involved. head tremor may be seen as a ""yes-yes"" or ""no-no"" motion. onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age. parkinsonian tremor is caused by damage to structures within the brain that control movement. the tremor is classically seen as a ""pill-rolling"" action of the hands but may also affect the chin, lips, legs, and trunk. dystonic tremor occurs in individuals of all ages who are affected by dystonia, a movement disorder in which sustained involuntary muscle contractions cause twisting motions or painful postures or positions."
what are the treatments for traumatic brain injury ?,"anyone with signs of moderate or severe tbi should receive medical attention as soon as possible. because little can be done to reverse the initial brain damage caused by trauma, medical personnel try to stabilize an individual with tbi and focus on preventing further injury. primary concerns include insuring proper oxygen supply to the brain and the rest of the body, maintaining adequate blood flow, and controlling blood pressure. imaging tests help in determining the diagnosis and prognosis of a tbi patient. patients with mild to moderate injuries may receive skull and neck x-rays to check for bone fractures or spinal instability. for moderate to severe cases, the imaging test is a computed tomography (ct) scan. moderately to severely injured patients receive rehabilitation that involves individually tailored treatment programs in the areas of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech/language therapy, physiatry (physical medicine), psychology/psychiatry, and social support."
what is (are) autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ?,"autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (alps) is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). alps is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes (lymphoproliferation). accumulation of excess lymphocytes results in enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), the liver (hepatomegaly), and the spleen (splenomegaly).  people with alps have an increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells (lymphoma) and may also be at increased risk of developing other cancers.  autoimmune disorders are also common in alps. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. most of the autoimmune disorders associated with alps target and damage blood cells. for example, the immune system may attack red blood cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), white blood cells (autoimmune neutropenia), or platelets (autoimmune thrombocytopenia). less commonly, autoimmune disorders that affect other organs and tissues occur in people with alps. these disorders can damage the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), liver (autoimmune hepatitis), eyes (uveitis), nerves (guillain-barre syndrome), or the connective tissues (systemic lupus erythematosus) that provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body.  skin problems, usually rashes or hives (urticaria), can occur in alps. occasionally, affected individuals develop hardened skin with painful lumps or patches (panniculitis). other rare signs and symptoms of alps include joint inflammation (arthritis), inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), mouth sores (oral ulcers), or an early loss of ovarian function (premature ovarian failure) may also occur in this disorder. affected individuals can also develop neurological damage (organic brain syndrome) with symptoms that may include headaches, seizures, or a decline in intellectual functions (dementia).  alps can have different patterns of signs and symptoms, which are sometimes considered separate forms of the disorder. in the most common form, lymphoproliferation generally becomes apparent during childhood. enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen frequently occur in affected individuals. autoimmune disorders typically develop several years later, most frequently as a combination of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, also called evans syndrome. people with this classic form of alps have a greatly increased risk of developing lymphoma compared with the general population.  other types of alps are very rare. in some affected individuals, severe lymphoproliferation begins around the time of birth, and autoimmune disorders and lymphoma develop at an early age. people with this pattern of signs and symptoms generally do not live beyond childhood. another form of alps involves lymphoproliferation and the tendency to develop systemic lupus erythematosus. individuals with this form of the disorder do not have an enlarged spleen.  some people have signs and symptoms that resemble those of alps, but the specific pattern of these signs and symptoms or the genetic cause may be different than in other forms. researchers disagree whether individuals with these non-classic forms should be considered to have alps or a separate condition."
what are the treatments for tardive dyskinesia ?,"treatment is highly individualized. the first step is generally to stop or minimize the use of the neuroleptic drug, but this can be done only under close supervision of the physician.. however, for patients with a severe underlying condition this may not be a feasible option. replacing the neuroleptic drug with substitute drugs may help some individuals. the only approved drug treatment for tardive dyskenesia is tetrabenazine, which is usually effective but can have side effects that need to be discussed prior to starting therapy. other drugs such as benzodiazepines, clozapine, or botulinum toxin injections also may be tried."
what is (are) mastocytic enterocolitis ?,"mastocytic enterocolitis is a term describing the condition of chronic, intractable diarrhea in people with normal colon or duodenum biopsy results, but with an increased number of mast cells in the colonic mucosa (the innermost layer of the colon). the increase in mast cells is not associated with systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis. it is unclear whether the accumulation of mast cells is a response to, or cause of, the mucosal inflammation that causes the symptoms of the condition. most individuals with this condition respond well to drugs affecting mast cell function."
what are the genetic changes related to atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome ?,"atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome often results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. mutations in at least seven genes appear to increase the risk of developing the disorder. mutations in a gene called cfh are most common; they have been found in about 30 percent of all cases of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. mutations in the other genes have each been identified in a smaller percentage of cases.  the genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome provide instructions for making proteins involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. this system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. the complement system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. the regulatory proteins associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.  mutations in the genes associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome lead to uncontrolled activation of the complement system. the overactive system attacks cells that line blood vessels in the kidneys, causing inflammation and the formation of abnormal clots. these abnormalities lead to kidney damage and, in many cases, kidney failure and esrd.  although gene mutations increase the risk of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, studies suggest that they are often not sufficient to cause the disease. in people with certain genetic changes, the signs and symptoms of the disorder may be triggered by factors including certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases, viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, or pregnancy.  some people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome do not have any known genetic changes or environmental triggers for the disease. in these cases, the disorder is described as idiopathic."

how to diagnose laron syndrome ?,"how is laron syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of laron syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that cause similar features. this generally includes blood tests to measure the levels of certain hormones that are often abnormal in people with laron syndrome. for example, affected people may have elevated levels of growth hormone and reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor i. genetic testing for changes (mutations) in the ghr gene can also be used to confirm a diagnosis in some cases."
who is at risk for fecal incontinence? ?,"nearly 18 million u.s. adultsabout one in 12have fecal incontinence.1 people of any age can have a bowel control problem, though fecal incontinence is more common in older adults. fecal incontinence is slightly more common among women. having any of the following can increase the risk:
                
- diarrhea, which is passing loose, watery stools three or more times a day  - urgency, or the sensation of having very little time to get to the toilet for a bowel movement  - a disease or injury that damages the nervous system  - poor overall health from multiple chronic, or long lasting, illnesses  - a difficult childbirth with injuries to the pelvic floorthe muscles, ligaments, and tissues that support the uterus, vagina, bladder, and rectum"
what is (are) psychotic disorders ?,"psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. people with psychoses lose touch with reality. two of the main symptoms are delusions and hallucinations. delusions are false beliefs, such as thinking that someone is plotting against you or that the tv is sending you secret messages. hallucinations are false perceptions, such as hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there.    schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. people with bipolar disorder may also have psychotic symptoms. other problems that can cause psychosis include alcohol and some drugs, brain tumors, brain infections, and stroke.    treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis. it might involve drugs to control symptoms and talk therapy. hospitalization is an option for serious cases where a person might be dangerous to himself or others."
what are the treatments for myotonia ?,"treatment for myotonia may include mexiletine, quinine, phenytoin, and other anticonvulsant drugs. physical therapy and other rehabilitative measures may help muscle function."
what are the genetic changes related to familial dilated cardiomyopathy ?,"mutations in more than 30 genes have been found to cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in cardiac muscle cells called cardiomyocytes.  many of these proteins play important roles in the contraction of the cardiac muscle through their association with cell structures called sarcomeres. sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. many other proteins associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of cardiomyocytes. the remaining proteins play various roles within cardiomyocytes to ensure their proper functioning.  mutations in one gene, ttn, account for approximately 20 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. the ttn gene provides instructions for making a protein called titin, which is found in the sarcomeres of many types of muscle cells, including cardiomyocytes. titin has several functions within sarcomeres. one of its most important jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. titin also plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres. the ttn gene mutations that cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy result in the production of an abnormally short titin protein. it is unclear how the altered protein causes familial dilated cardiomyopathy, but it is likely that it impairs sarcomere function and disrupts chemical signaling.  it is unclear how mutations in the other genes cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy. it is likely that the changes impair cardiomyocyte function and reduce the ability of these cells to contract, weakening and thinning cardiac muscle.  people with familial dilated cardiomyopathy often do not have an identified mutation in any of the known associated genes. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.  familial dilated cardiomyopathy is described as nonsyndromic or isolated because it typically affects only the heart. however, dilated cardiomyopathy can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. these forms of the condition are described as syndromic and are caused by mutations in other genes. additionally, there are many nongenetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including viral infection and chronic alcohol abuse."
what is (are) guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency ?,"guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency is an inherited disorder that primarily affects the brain and muscles. without early treatment, people with this disorder have neurological problems that are usually severe. these problems include intellectual disability, speech development limited to a few words, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). affected individuals may also exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction or self-injurious behaviors such as head-banging. other features of this disorder can include involuntary movements (extrapyramidal dysfunction) such as tremors or facial tics.  people with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency may have weak muscle tone and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting or walking. in severe cases they may lose previously acquired skills such as the ability to support their head or to sit unsupported."
what is (are) familial hemiplegic migraine ?,"familial hemiplegic migraine (fhm) is a form of migraine headache that runs in families. migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. these recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and may last from a few hours to a few days. people with familial hemiplegic migraine experience an aura that comes before the headache. the most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. in people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). an aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour. researchers have identified three forms of familial hemiplegic migraine known as fhm1, fhm2, and fhm3. each of the three types is caused by mutations in a different gene."
what is (are) laryngomalacia ?,"laryngomalacia is an abnormality of the cartilage of the voice box (larynx) that is present at birth. the condition is characterized by ""floppy"" cartilage collapsing over the larynx when air is drawn into the lungs (inspiration), leading to airway obstruction. this obstruction causes a noise which may sound like nasal congestion or may be a more high-pitched sound (stridor). airway sounds typically begin at 4-6 weeks of age. affected infants have a higher risk of gastroesophageal reflux, and in severe cases may have feeding problems. in rare cases, hypoxemia or hypoventilation may interfere with normal growth and development. the cause of this condition is unknown, but it is thought to be due to delayed maturation of the supporting structures of the larynx. in more than 90% of cases it gradually improves on its own, and noises disappear by age 2 in virtually all infants."
how to diagnose periventricular heterotopia ?,"what are the recommended evaluations for patients diagnosed with periventricular nodular heterotopia? the following evaluations are recommended:[1823]  imaging exams of the brain to establish the diagnosis  evaluation by a neurologist  evaluation by a doctor specialized in epilepsy if seizures are present  psychiatric evaluation if necessary  magnetic resonance angiography (mra) of the brain vessels, carotid arteries, and aorta because of the risk for stroke  evaluation by a cardiologist and either echocardiogram or a heart magnetic resonance imaging (mri) because of the risk for aortic aneurysm  evaluation by a hematologist if findings suggest a bleeding diathesis."

what to do for irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help ibs symptoms. eating meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables may help.
                
certain foods and drinks may cause ibs symptoms in some children, such as
                
- foods high in fat  - milk products  - drinks with caffeine  - drinks with large amounts of artificial sweeteners, which are substances used in place of sugar  - foods that may cause gas, such as beans and cabbage
                
children with ibs may want to limit or avoid these foods. keeping a food diary is a good way to track which foods cause symptoms so they can be excluded from or reduced in the diet.
                
dietary fiber may lessen constipation in children with ibs, but it may not help with lowering pain. fiber helps keep stool soft so it moves smoothly through the colon. the academy of nutrition and dietetics recommends children consume age plus 5 grams of fiber daily. a 7-year-old child, for example, should get 7 plus 5, or 12 grams, of fiber a day.3 fiber may cause gas and trigger symptoms in some children with ibs. increasing fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day may help reduce the risk of increased gas and bloating.
                
medications
                
the health care provider will select medications based on the childs symptoms. caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider.
                
- fiber supplements. fiber supplements may be recommended to relieve constipation when increasing dietary fiber is ineffective.  - laxatives. constipation can be treated with laxative medications. laxatives work in different ways, and a health care provider can provide information about which type is best. caregivers should not give children laxatives unless told to do so by a health care provider. more information about different types of laxatives is provided in the niddk health topic, constipation.  - antidiarrheals. loperamide has been found to reduce diarrhea in children with ibs, though it does not reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. loperamide reduces stool frequency and improves stool consistency by slowing the movement of stool through the colon. medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given if told to do so by a health care provider.  - antispasmodics. antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain.  - antidepressants. tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in low doses can help relieve ibs symptoms including abdominal pain. these medications are thought to reduce the perception of pain, improve mood and sleep patterns, and adjust the activity of the gi tract.
                
probiotics
                
probiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the gi tract. studies have found that probiotics, specifically bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of ibs when taken in large enough amounts. but more research is needed. probiotics can be found in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. a health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve ibs symptoms. more information about probiotics can be found in the national center for complementary and alternative medicine fact sheet an introduction to probiotics.
                
therapies for mental health problems
                
the following therapies can help improve ibs symptoms due to mental health problems:
                
- talk therapy. talking with a therapist may reduce stress and improve ibs symptoms. two types of talk therapy used to treat ibs are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the childs thoughts and actions. psychodynamic therapy focuses on how emotions affect ibs symptoms. this type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques.  - hypnotherapy. in hypnotherapy, the therapist uses hypnosis to help the child relax into a trancelike state. this type of therapy may help the child relax the muscles in the colon."

what is (are) preeclampsia ?,"preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which affected women develop high blood pressure (hypertension) and can also have abnormally high levels of protein in their urine. this condition usually occurs in the last few months of pregnancy and often requires the early delivery of the infant.  many women with mild preeclampsia do not feel ill, and the problem is first detected through blood pressure and urine testing in their doctor's office. other early features of the disorder are swelling (edema) of the face or hands and a weight gain of more than 2 pounds within a few days. more severely affected women may experience headaches, dizziness, irritability, shortness of breath, a decrease in urination, upper abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. vision changes may develop, including flashing lights or spots, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), blurry vision, or temporary blindness.  in most cases, preeclampsia is mild and goes away within a few weeks after the baby is born. in severe cases, however, preeclampsia can impact the mother's organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys and can lead to life-threatening complications. extreme hypertension in the mother can cause bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). the effects of high blood pressure on the brain (hypertensive encephalopathy) may also result in seizures. if seizures occur, the condition is considered to have progressed to eclampsia, which can result in coma. without treatment to help prevent seizures, about 1 in 200 women with preeclampsia develop eclampsia.  between 10 and 20 percent of women with severe preeclampsia develop another potentially life-threatening complication called hellp syndrome. hellp stands for hemolysis (premature red blood cell breakdown), elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelets (cell fragments involved in blood clotting), which are the key features of this condition.  severe preeclampsia can also affect the fetus, with impairment of blood and oxygen flow leading to growth problems or stillbirth. infants delivered early due to preeclampsia may have complications associated with prematurity, such as breathing problems caused by underdeveloped lungs.  women who have had preeclampsia have approximately twice the lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke than do women in the general population. researchers suggest this may be due to common factors that increase the risk of preeclampsia, heart disease, and stroke."
what are the genetic changes related to warsaw breakage syndrome ?,"mutations in the ddx11 gene cause warsaw breakage syndrome. the ddx11 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called chlr1. this enzyme functions as a helicase. helicases are enzymes that attach (bind) to dna and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the dna molecule. this unwinding is necessary for copying (replicating) dna in preparation for cell division, and for repairing damaged dna and any mistakes that are made when dna is copied. in addition, after dna is copied, chlr1 plays a role in ensuring proper separation of each chromosome during cell division. by helping repair mistakes in dna and ensuring proper dna replication, the chlr1 enzyme is involved in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.  ddx11 gene mutations severely reduce or completely eliminate chlr1 enzyme activity. as a result, the enzyme cannot bind to dna and cannot unwind the dna strands to help with dna replication and repair. a lack of functional chlr1 impairs cell division and leads to an accumulation of dna damage. this dna damage can appear as breaks in the dna, giving the condition its name. it is unclear how these problems in dna maintenance lead to the specific abnormalities characteristic of warsaw breakage syndrome."

what are the genetic changes related to dyskeratosis congenita ?,"in about half of people with dyskeratosis congenita, the disorder is caused by mutations in the tert, terc, dkc1, or tinf2 gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain structures known as telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. in a small number of individuals with dyskeratosis congenita, mutations in other genes involved with telomere maintenance have been identified. other affected individuals have no mutations in any of the genes currently associated with dyskeratosis congenita. in these cases, the cause of the disorder is unknown, but other unidentified genes related to telomere maintenance are likely involved.  telomeres help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading). in most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. after a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).  telomeres are maintained by two important protein complexes called telomerase and shelterin. telomerase helps maintain normal telomere length by adding small repeated segments of dna to the ends of chromosomes each time the cell divides. the main components of telomerase, called htr and htert, are produced from the terc and tert genes, respectively. the htr component is an rna molecule, a chemical cousin of dna. it provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of dna that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes. the function of the htert component is to add the new dna segment to chromosome ends. the dkc1 gene provides instructions for making another protein that is important in telomerase function. this protein, called dyskerin, attaches (binds) to htr and helps stabilize the telomerase complex.  the shelterin complex helps protect telomeres from the cell's dna repair process. without the protection of shelterin, the repair mechanism would sense the chromosome ends as abnormal breaks in the dna sequence and either attempt to join the ends together or initiate apoptosis. the tinf2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the shelterin complex.  tert, terc, dkc1, or tinf2 gene mutations result in dysfunction of the telomerase or shelterin complexes, leading to impaired maintenance of telomeres and reduced telomere length. cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres. as a result, people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body such as cells of the nail beds, hair follicles, skin, lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), and bone marrow.  breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the development of cancer in people with dyskeratosis congenita."

is severe congenital neutropenia inherited ?,"most cases of severe congenital neutropenia are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. some of these cases are associated with changes in specific genes; however in some cases the cause of the disorder is unknown.  many cases of severe congenital neutropenia are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  less often, this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  in rare cases, severe congenital neutropenia is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. in these cases, the gene that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

if the disease has affected your child's coronary (heart) arteries, a pediatric cardiologist will confirm the diagnosis and give ongoing treatment. pediatric cardiologists treat children who have heart problems.
                
other specialists also may be involved in treating children who have kawasaki disease.
                
signs and symptoms
                
the doctor will check your child for the classic signs and symptoms of kawasaki disease.
                
the doctor will rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. these diseases include rocky mountain spotted fever, scarlet fever, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
                
generally, your child will be diagnosed with kawasaki disease if he or she has a fever that lasts longer than 5 days plus four other classic signs or symptoms of the disease.
                
however, not all children have classic signs and symptoms of kawasaki disease. tests and procedures can help confirm whether a child has the disease.
                
tests and procedures
                
echocardiography
                
if the doctor thinks that your child has kawasaki disease, he or she will likely recommendechocardiography(ek-o-kar-de-og-ra-fee), or echo. this painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart and coronary arteries.
                
echo also can help show the disease's effects over time, if any, on your child's coronary arteries. often, the disease's effects on the coronary arteries don't show up until the second or third week after the first symptoms appear. thus, this test is done regularly after the diagnosis.
                
some children who have kawasaki disease don't have the classic signs and symptoms of the acute phase. doctors may not diagnose these children until 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of the disease. this is when another common sign of kawasaki disease occurspeeling of the skin on the fingers and toes.
                
if your child is diagnosed at this point, he or she will likely need echo right away to see whether the disease has affected the coronary arteries.
                
other diagnostic tests
                
doctors also use other tests to help diagnose kawasaki disease, such as:
                
blood tests. the results from blood tests can show whether the body's blood vessels are inflamed.
                
chest x ray. this painless test creates pictures of structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. a chest x ray can show whether kawasaki disease has affected the heart.
                
ekg (electrocardiogram). this simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. an ekg can show whether kawasaki disease has affected the heart."

what is (are) otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia ?,"otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (osmed) is a skeletal disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and severe hearing loss. the condition involves the ears (oto-), affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-), and enlarges the ends (epiphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. the features of osmed are similar to those of another skeletal disorder, weissenbacher-zweymller syndrome.  people with osmed are often shorter than average because the bones in their legs are unusually short. other skeletal features include enlarged joints; short arms, hands, and fingers; and flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly). people with the disorder often experience back and joint pain, limited joint movement, and arthritis that begins early in life.  severe high-tone hearing loss is common in people with osmed. typical facial features include protruding eyes; a flattened bridge of the nose; an upturned nose with a large, rounded tip; and a small lower jaw. virtually all affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). the skeletal features of osmed tend to diminish during childhood, but other signs and symptoms, such as hearing loss and joint pain, persist into adulthood."
what causes steatocystoma multiplex ?,"what causes steatocystoma multiplex? mutations in a gene called keratin 17 (krt17) have been identified in some individuals with inherited steatocystoma multiplex. in these families the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. in other cases the condition occurs sporadically. this may mean that it is due to a gene mutation that was not inherited, but occurred for the first time in the affected individual. a sporadic condition may also be non-genetic and occur by chance, in which case it is not likely to recur in a family.  in many sporadic cases of steatocystoma multiplex, mutations in the krt17 gene have not been identified. cases of steatocystoma multiplex have also been reported in association with pachyonychia congenita, acrokeratosis verruciformis, hypertrophic lichen planus, hypohidrosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and natal teeth."

what is (are) melanoma ?,"key points
                    - melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in melanocytes (cells that color the skin).    - there are different types of cancer that start in the skin.    - melanoma can occur anywhere on the skin.     - unusual moles, exposure to sunlight, and health history can affect the risk of melanoma.    - signs of melanoma include a change in the way a mole or pigmented area looks.     - tests that examine the skin are used to detect (find) and diagnose melanoma.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in melanocytes (cells that color the skin).
                    the skin is the bodys largest organ. it protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin d. the skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells:          -  squamous cells: thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis.    -  basal cells: round cells under the squamous cells.    -  melanocytes: cells that make melanin and are found in the lower part of the epidermis. melanin is the pigment that gives skin its natural color. when skin is exposed to the sun or artificial light, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken.        the number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing over the last 40 years. melanoma is most common in adults, but it is sometimes found in children and adolescents. (see the pdq summary on unusual cancers of childhood treatment for more information on melanoma in children and adolescents.)
                
                
                    there are different types of cancer that start in the skin.
                    there are two forms of skin cancer: melanoma and nonmelanoma.   melanoma is a rare form of skin cancer. it is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body than other types of skin cancer. when melanoma starts in the skin, it is called cutaneous melanoma. melanoma may also occur in mucous membranes (thin, moist layers of tissue that cover surfaces such as the lips). this pdq summary is about cutaneous (skin) melanoma and melanoma that affects the mucous membranes.   the most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. they are nonmelanoma skin cancers. nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. (see the pdq summary on skin cancer treatment for more information on basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer.)
                
                
                    melanoma can occur anywhere on the skin.
                    in men, melanoma is often found on the trunk (the area from the shoulders to the hips) or the head and neck. in women, melanoma forms most often on the arms and legs.    when melanoma occurs in the eye, it is called intraocular or ocular melanoma. (see the pdq summary on intraocular (uveal) melanoma treatment for more information.)"
how to diagnose familial isolated hyperparathyroidism ?,"how is familial isolated hyperparathyroidism diagnosed? the diagnosis of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (fihp) is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. this means that it is diagnosed when no symptoms or genetic features of other forms of familial hyperparathyroidism are present. fihp may be the only feature of another condition that is not manifesting completely, or it may be a distinct condition due to mutations in genes that have not yet been identified. clinical exams, laboratory tests, and histological (microscopic) findings are needed before making a diagnosis of fihp. a diagnosis of fihp may include the findings of: hypercalcemia (defined as a serum calcium level greater than 10.5 mg/dl) inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (pth) concentrations parathyroid adenomas exclusion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men 1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (hpt-jt) in the majority of people with fihp, genetic mutations are not found. however, in some people, mutations in the men1, casr, and cdc73 (hrpt2) genes have been reported. at this time, no gene has been associated exclusively with fihp."
what is (are) nemaline myopathy ?,"nemaline myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. people with nemaline myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, but it is typically most severe in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. this weakness can worsen over time. affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties, foot deformities, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and joint deformities (contractures). most people with nemaline myopathy are able to walk, although some affected children may begin walking later than usual. as the condition progresses, some people may require wheelchair assistance. in severe cases, the muscles used for breathing are affected and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur.  nemaline myopathy is divided into six types. in order of decreasing severity, the types are: severe congenital, amish, intermediate congenital, typical congenital, childhood-onset, and adult-onset. the types are distinguished by the age when symptoms first appear and the severity of symptoms; however, there is overlap among the various types. the severe congenital type is the most life-threatening. most individuals with this type do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure. the amish type solely affects the old order amish population of pennsylvania and is typically fatal in early childhood. the most common type of nemaline myopathy is the typical congenital type, which is characterized by muscle weakness and feeding problems beginning in infancy. most of these individuals do not have severe breathing problems and can walk unassisted. people with the childhood-onset type usually develop muscle weakness in adolescence. the adult-onset type is the mildest of all the various types. people with this type usually develop muscle weakness between ages 20 and 50."
how to prevent hearing loss ?,"researchers funded by the national institutes of health are studying the causes of hearing loss as well as new treatments. for example, they are studying ways to improve hearing aids so that you can hear certain sounds more clearly even when you are surrounded by background noise. they are also working to to improve cochlear implants and develop diagnostic methods to determine who would benefit from two versus one cochlear implant, especially in young children. finding ways to improve access to accessible and affordable hearing health care, including screening and assessment, hearing aid selection and fitting, and rehabilitation of hearing loss, is also a goal of currently funded research."

is breast cancer inherited ?,"most cases of breast cancer are not caused by inherited genetic factors. these cancers are associated with somatic mutations in breast cells that are acquired during a person's lifetime, and they do not cluster in families.  in hereditary breast cancer, the way that cancer risk is inherited depends on the gene involved. for example, mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer. although breast cancer is more common in women than in men, the mutated gene can be inherited from either the mother or the father.  in the other syndromes discussed above, the gene mutations that increase cancer risk also have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. it is important to note that people inherit an increased likelihood of developing cancer, not the disease itself. not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will ultimately develop cancer.  in many cases of breast cancer that clusters in families, the genetic basis for the disease and the mechanism of inheritance are unclear."

"what is (are) neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa ?","neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (narp) is a condition that causes a variety of signs and symptoms chiefly affecting the nervous system. beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most people with narp experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). many affected individuals also have vision loss caused by changes in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). in some cases, the vision loss results from a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. this eye disease causes the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually to deteriorate.  learning disabilities and developmental delays are often seen in children with narp, and older individuals with this condition may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia). other features of narp include seizures, hearing loss, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects). these signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals."
what causes sleep apnea ?,"when you're awake, throat muscles help keep your airway stiff and open so air can flow into your lungs. when you sleep, these muscles relax, which narrows your throat.
                
normally, this narrowing doesnt prevent air from flowing into and out of your lungs. but if you have sleep apnea, your airway can become partially or fully blocked because:
                
your throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal.
                
your tongue and tonsils (tissue masses in the back of your mouth) are large compared with the opening into your windpipe.
                
you're overweight. the extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe. this narrows the inside of the windpipe, which makes it harder to keep open.
                
the shape of your head and neck (bony structure) may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area.
                
the aging process limits your brain signals' ability to keep your throat muscles stiff during sleep. thus, your airway is more likely to narrow or collapse.
                
not enough air flows into your lungs if your airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep. as a result, loud snoring and a drop in your blood oxygen level can occur.
                
if the oxygen drops to a dangerous level, it triggers your brain to disturb your sleep. this helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. normal breathing then starts again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.
                
frequent drops in your blood oxygen level and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones. these hormones raise your heart rate and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). the hormones also can raise your risk for, or worsen, heart failure.
                
untreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how your body uses energy. these changes increase your risk for obesity and diabetes."
what is (are) oral leukoplakia ?,"oral leukoplakia is a diagnosis of exclusion. it describes a white plaque that does not rub off and cannot be characterized as any other condition. though it may occur in any part of the mouth, it generally affects the tongue, gums, and inner cheek. physicians will usually biopsy oral leukoplakia lesions as 20-40% of cases are precancerous or cancerous at the time of biopsy and another 8-15% become cancerous over time. the exact cause of oral leukoplakia is not known. factors that may increase the risk of developing oral leukoplakia include smoking, alcohol use, vitamin deficiencies, malocclusion, and a weakened immune system.treatment depends on the biopsy results and the size, appearance, and location of the oral leukoplakia. removal or ablation of the lesion by surgery, laser, or cryotherapy (use of low temperature) may be recommended."
how to diagnose adult acute myeloid leukemia ?,"tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult aml. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - the portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.             -   peripheral blood smear : a procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.     -   bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.     -   cytogenetic analysis : a laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.    -   immunophenotyping : a process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this process is used to diagnose the subtype of aml by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system. for example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. a chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.    -   reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test (rtpcr): a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes. this test is used to diagnose certain types of aml including acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl)."
what is (are) carotid artery disease ?,"carotid artery disease is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the carotid arteries. you have two common carotid arteries, one on each side of your neck. they each divide into internal and external carotid arteries.
                
the internal carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. the external carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your face, scalp, and neck.
                
carotid arteries
                

                
carotid artery disease is serious because it can cause a stroke, also called a brain attack. a stroke occurs if blood flow to your brain is cut off.
                
if blood flow is cut off for more than a few minutes, the cells in your brain start to die. this impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control. a stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death.
                
overview
                
carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states. over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. this may limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.
                
atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body. for example, if plaque builds up in the coronary (heart) arteries, a heart attack can occur. if plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, a stroke can occur.
                
a stroke also can occur if blood clots form in the carotid arteries. this can happen if the plaque in an artery cracks or ruptures. blood cell fragments called platelets (plate-lets) stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. blood clots can partly or fully block a carotid artery.
                
a piece of plaque or a blood clot also can break away from the wall of the carotid artery. the plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brain's smaller arteries. this can block blood flow in the artery and cause a stroke.
                
carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until the carotid arteries are severely narrowed or blocked. for some people, a stroke is the first sign of the disease.
                
outlook
                
carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states. other conditions, such as certain heart problems and bleeding in the brain, also can cause strokes.lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat carotid artery disease and may reduce the risk of stroke.
                
if you think you're having a stroke, you need urgent treatment. call 911 right away if you have symptoms of a stroke. do not drive yourself to the hospital.you have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. the sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery."

what is (are) cyclic vomiting syndrome ?,"cyclic vomiting syndrome, sometimes referred to as cvs, is an increasingly recognized disorder with sudden, repeated attacksalso called episodesof severe nausea, vomiting, and physical exhaustion that occur with no apparent cause. the episodes can last from a few hours to several days. episodes can be so severe that a person has to stay in bed for days, unable to go to school or work. a person may need treatment at an emergency room or a hospital during episodes. after an episode, a person usually experiences symptom-free periods lasting a few weeks to several months. to people who have the disorder, as well as their family members and friends, cyclic vomiting syndrome can be disruptive and frightening.
                
the disorder can affect a person for months, years, or decades. each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones, meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity."
what is (are) prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia ?,"benign prostatic hyperplasiaalso called bphis a condition in men in which the prostate gland is enlarged and not cancerous. benign prostatic hyperplasia is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy or benign prostatic obstruction.
                
the prostate goes through two main growth periods as a man ages. the first occurs early in puberty, when the prostate doubles in size. the second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a mans life. benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second growth phase.
                
as the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. the bladder wall becomes thicker. eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder. the narrowing of the urethra and urinary retentionthe inability to empty the bladder completelycause many of the problems associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia."
what are the symptoms of retinoschisis autosomal dominant ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of retinoschisis autosomal dominant? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for retinoschisis autosomal dominant. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of macular pigmentation - autosomal dominant inheritance - peripheral retinal degeneration - retinoschisis - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) monogenic forms of diabetes: neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young ?,"testing for monogenic diabetes involves providing a blood sample from which dna is isolated. the dna is analyzed for changes in the genes that cause monogenic diabetes. abnormal results can determine the gene responsible for diabetes in a particular individual or show whether someone is likely to develop a monogenic form of diabetes in the future. genetic testing can also be helpful in selecting the most appropriate treatment for individuals with monogenic diabetes. prenatal testing can diagnose these conditions in unborn children.
                
most forms of monogenic diabetes are caused by dominant mutations, meaning that the condition can be passed on to children when only one parent is affected. in contrast, if the mutation is a recessive mutation, a disease gene must be inherited from both parents for diabetes to occur. for recessive forms of monogenic diabetes, testing can indicate whether parents or siblings without disease are carriers for recessive genetic conditions that could be inherited by their children.
                
if you suspect that you or a member of your family may have a monogenic form of diabetes, you should seek help from health care professionals-physicians and genetic counselors-who have specialized knowledge and experience in this area. they can determine whether genetic testing is appropriate, select the genetic tests that should be performed, and provide information about the basic principles of genetics, genetic testing options, and confidentiality issues. they also can review the test results with the patient or parent after testing, make recommendations about how to proceed, and discuss testing options for other family members."
what is (are) potocki-lupski syndrome ?,"potocki-lupski syndrome (ptls) is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra copy of a tiny portion of chromosome 17 (duplication of 17p11.2). people with this duplication often have low muscle tone, poor feeding, and failure to thrive during infancy. they may also present with delayed development of motor and verbal milestones. in addition, many individuals display some behaviors commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders. while most cases of potocki-lupski syndrome occur sporadically, in rare cases, it may be inherited. treatment involves physical, occupational, and speech therapy."
is x-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda inherited ?,"x-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the trappc2 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  in x-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. she can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. in rare cases, however, females who carry a trappc2 mutation may develop arthritis in early adulthood."
how many people are affected by frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 ?,"the worldwide prevalence of ftdp-17 is unknown. in the netherlands, where the disease prevalence has been studied, it is estimated to affect 1 in 1 million people. however, the disorder is likely underdiagnosed, so it may actually be more common than this.  ftdp-17 probably accounts for a small percentage of all cases of frontotemporal dementia."
is very long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

how to diagnose schistosomiasis ?,"how is schistosomiasis diagnosed? examination of stool and/or urine for ova is the primary method of diagnosis for schistosomiasis. the choice of sample depends on the suspected species, which may be determined by careful review of travel and residence history. the sensitivity of this testing can be limited by the intensity of infection. for best results, three samples should be collected on different days.  a blood sample can also be tested for evidence of infection. blood tests are indicated for travelers or immigrants from endemic areas who have not been treated (or not treated appropriately) in the past. the most common tests detect antibodies to the adult worm. for accurate results, the blood sample tested should be collected at least 6 to 8 weeks after likely infection. blood testing may not be appropriate for patients who have been repeatedly infected and treated in the past because antibodies can persist despite cure. in these patients, blood testing cannot distinguish between a past or current infection. a specific blood test has been developed for this population (which can detect an active infection based on the presence of  schistosomal antigen), but this test is not commercially available in the united states and is currently being studied for its ability to detect mild infections."
what causes intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ?,"what causes intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy? largely, the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (icp) is unknown. icp is present in approximately 1% of pregnancies in the united states. it is thought to be caused by a mixture of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. risk factors include: a personal or family history of cholestasis of pregnancy a history of liver disease a multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc) approximately 15% of women with icp have a mutation in either the abcb11 orabcb4 gene. mutations within these genes increase the likelihood that a woman will develop icp. mutations within the abcb11 and abcb4 gene(s) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations within the gene. a person with a mutation in either theabcb11 or abcb4 gene has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."
how to prevent eastern equine encephalitis ?,"there is no vaccine against eastern equine encephalitis virus (eeev) for humans. reducing exposure to mosquitoes is the best defense against infection with eeev and other mosquito-borne viruses. there are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. 
   
   -  use repellent: when outdoors, use insect repellent containing deet, picaridin, ir3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. the repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. always follow the directions on the package.  
   -  wear protective clothing: wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.  
   -  install and repair screens: have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  
   -  keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use."
how many people are affected by limb-girdle muscular dystrophy ?,"it is difficult to determine the prevalence of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy because its features vary and overlap with those of other muscle disorders. prevalence estimates range from 1 in 14,500 to 1 in 123,000 individuals."

what causes mondini dysplasia ?,"what causes mondini dysplasia? the underlying cause of mondini dysplasia (md) in most individuals appears to remain unclear. some have suggested that retinoids (vitamin a) or other factors a fetus may be exposed to early in pregnancy have contributed to some cases of isolated md (occurring with no other abnormalities). the potential role of these factors has created increased difficulty in determining the real cause of isolated md. mutations in the slc26a4 gene cause both pendred syndrome and dfnb4 (non-syndromic hearing loss with inner ear abnormalities), which are both associated with md. though mutations in the slc26a4 gene have also been found in individuals with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) with and without md, studies have shown there does not appear to be a relationship between isolated md and the slc26a4 gene. thus hearing impairment in individuals with isolated md may be caused by factors other than mutations in the slc26a4 gene. more recently, a type of mutation called a microdeletion (a tiny loss of genetic material on a chromosome that may span several genes) involving the pou3f4 gene on the x chromosome was detected in some individuals with familial md. in cases where mondini dysplasia is associated with a specific syndrome, the cause of the syndrome in the affected individual is assumed to be related to the occurrence of md in those cases. syndromes that have been associated with md include klippel feil syndrome, pendred syndrome, digeorge syndrome, and some chromosomal trisomies."

what is (are) smoking ?,"there's no way around it. smoking is bad for your health. smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. it is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. these include lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke and cataracts. women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (sids). your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do.    e-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. they are battery-operated smoking devices. not much is known about the health risks of using them.    quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. the earlier you quit, the greater the benefit.     nih: national cancer institute"
is maternally inherited diabetes and deafness inherited ?,"midd is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtdna. because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children.  most of the body's cells contain thousands of mitochondria, each with one or more copies of mtdna. these cells can have a mix of mitochondria containing mutated and unmutated dna (heteroplasmy). the severity of midd is thought to be associated with the percentage of mitochondria with the mtdna mutation."
what is (are) ovarian cysts ?,"a cyst is a fluid-filled sac. in most cases a cyst on the ovary does no harm and goes away by itself. most women have them sometime during their lives. cysts are rarely cancerous in women under 50. cysts sometimes hurt - but not always. often, a woman finds out about a cyst when she has a pelvic exam.     if you're in your childbearing years or past menopause, have no symptoms, and have a fluid-filled cyst, you may choose to monitor the cyst. you may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause or if the cyst does not go away. birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.    a health problem that may involve ovarian cysts is polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). women with pcos can have high levels of male hormones, irregular or no periods and small ovarian cysts.    dept. of health and human services office on women's health"
what are the symptoms of urine blockage in newborns ?,"before leaving the hospital, a baby with urine blockage may urinate only small amounts or may not urinate at all. as part of the routine newborn exam, the health care provider may feel an enlarged kidney or find a closed urethra, which may indicate urine blockage. sometimes urine blockage is not apparent until a child develops symptoms of a urinary tract infection (uti), including
                
- fever  - irritability  - not eating  - nausea  - diarrhea  - vomiting  - cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - urinating often

what is (are) autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ?,"autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a disorder of electrolyte metabolism characterized by excess loss of salt in the urine and high concentrations of sodium in sweat, stool, and saliva. the disorder involves multiple organ systems and is especially dangerous in the newborn period. laboratory tests may show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and increased plasma renin activity with high levels of aldosterone in the blood. respiratory tract infections are common in affected children. treatment involves aggressive salt replacement and control of hyperkalemia. the disorder may become less severe with age. autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (pha1b) is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the genes coding for the subunits of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (scnn1a, scnn1b and scnn1g)."
what is (are) gallbladder cancer ?,"key points
                    - gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.    - being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer.     - signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain.     - gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.     - tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer.     - certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.
                    gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. the gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. the gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat. when food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine.      the wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue.          -  mucosal (inner) layer.    - muscularis (middle, muscle) layer.     -  serosal (outer) layer.        between these layers is supporting connective tissue. primary gallbladder cancer starts in the inner layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.
                
                
                    gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.
                    gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:         - there are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer.    - the symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses.    - the gallbladder is hidden behind the liver.         gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. patients with gallstones rarely develop gallbladder cancer."

how to diagnose problems with smell ?,"scientists have developed tests to determine the nature and extent of a person's smell disorder. tests measure the smallest amount of odor patients can detect as well as how accurately a person can identify different smells. an easily administered ""scratch and sniff"" test allows a person to scratch pieces of paper treated to release different odors, sniff them, and try to identify each odor from a list of possibilities. in this way, doctors can determine whether a person has a decreased ability to smell (hyposmia), the inability to detect any odors (anosmia), or another kind of smell disorder. in some cases, your doctor may need to perform a nasal examination with a nasal endoscope, an instrument that illuminates and magnifies the areas of the nose where the problem may exist. this test can help identify the area and extent of the problem and help your doctor select the right treatment. if your doctor suspects that upper regions of the nose and nasal sinuses that can't be seen by an endoscope are involved, he or she may order a specialized x-ray procedure, usually a ct scan, to look further into the nose and sinuses."
what causes galactosialidosis ?,"what causes galactosialidosis? galactosialidosis is caused by mutations in the ctsa gene. the ctsa gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin a, which is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. these compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. cathepsin a works together with two enzymes, neuraminidase 1 and beta-galactosidase, to form a protein complex. this complex breaks down sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). cathepsin a is also found on the cell surface, where it forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and a protein called elastin binding protein. elastin binding protein plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, a component of the connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. ctsa mutations interfere with the normal function of cathepsin a. most mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin a, impairing its ability to form complexes with neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. as a result, these other enzymes are not functional, or they break down prematurely. galactosialidosis belongs to a large family of lysosomal storage disorders, each caused by the deficiency of a specific lysosomal enzyme or protein. in galactosialidosis, impaired functioning of cathepsin a and other enzymes causes certain substances to accumulate in the lysosomes."

what are the treatments for coma ?,"once an individual is out of immediate danger, the medical care team focuses on preventing infections and maintaining a healthy physical state. this will often include preventing pneumonia and bedsores and providing balanced nutrition. physical therapy may also be used to prevent contractures (permanent muscular contractions) and deformities of the bones, joints, and muscles that would limit recovery for those who emerge from coma."
what is (are) microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome ?,"microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome is a disorder that mainly affects females. in people with this condition, one or both eyes may be very small or poorly developed (microphthalmia). affected individuals also typically have unusual linear skin markings on the head and neck. these markings follow the paths along which cells migrate as the skin develops before birth (lines of blaschko). the skin defects generally improve over time and leave variable degrees of scarring.  the signs and symptoms of microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome vary widely, even among affected individuals within the same family. in addition to the characteristic eye problems and skin markings, this condition can cause abnormalities in the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. a hole in the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm), which is called a diaphragmatic hernia, may occur in people with this disorder. affected individuals may also have short stature and fingernails and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy)."
what is (are) bell's palsy ?,"bell's palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. it usually affects just one side of the face. symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. they can range from mild to severe and include       - twitching    - weakness    - paralysis    - drooping eyelid or corner of mouth    - drooling    - dry eye or mouth    - excessive tearing in the eye    - impaired ability to taste       scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. you are most likely to get bell's palsy if you are pregnant, diabetic or sick with a cold or flu.    three out of four patients improve without treatment. with or without treatment, most people begin to get better within 2 weeks and recover completely within 3 to 6 months.     nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke"
what is (are) familial hypercholesterolemia ?,"familial hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood due to mutations in the ldlr gene. people with hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease, as well as health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in other tissues (e.g., in the tendons and skin). familial hypercholesterolemia tends to be passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. there are other hereditary forms of hypercholesterolemia caused by mutations in the apob, ldlrap1, or pcsk9 gene. however, most cases of high cholesterol are not caused by a single inherited condition, but result from a combination of lifestyle choices and the effects of variations in many genes."
what are the genetic changes related to malignant hyperthermia ?,"variations of the cacna1s and ryr1 genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia.  researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. mutations in the ryr1 gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as mhs1. these mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. another form of the condition, mhs5, results from mutations in the cacna1s gene. these mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.  the ryr1 and cacna1s genes provide instructions for making proteins that play essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). for the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. the proteins produced from the ryr1 and cacna1s genes are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. in response to certain signals, the cacna1s protein helps activate the ryr1 channel, which releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. the resulting increase in calcium ion concentration inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract.  mutations in the ryr1 or cacna1s gene cause the ryr1 channel to open more easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. as a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. an overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia. an increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis).  the genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (mhs2, mhs4, and mhs6) are still under study. a form of the condition known as mhs3 has been linked to the cacna2d1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in activating the ryr1 channel to release calcium ions into muscle cells. although this gene is thought to be related to malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been identified."

what are the genetic changes related to dowling-degos disease ?,"mutations in the krt5 gene cause dowling-degos disease. the krt5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 5. keratins are a family of proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. keratin 5 is produced in cells called keratinocytes found in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). keratin 5 is one component of molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. these filaments assemble into strong networks that help attach keratinocytes together and anchor the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. researchers believe that keratin 5 may also play a role in transporting melanosomes, which are cellular structures that produce a pigment called melanin. the transport of these structures into keratinocytes is important for normal skin coloration (pigmentation).  krt5 gene mutations that cause dowling-degos disease lead to a decrease in the amount of functional keratin 5 protein that is produced. a reduction in keratin 5 can impair the formation of keratin intermediate filaments. as a result, the normal organization of the epidermis is altered, leading to the development of different types of skin lesions. additionally, a decrease in keratin 5 may disrupt the movement of pigment-carrying melanosomes into keratinocytes, where they are needed for normal skin pigmentation. this disruption of melanosome transport is thought to cause the pigmentation abnormalities seen in individuals with dowling-degos disease.  some people with dowling-degos disease do not have an identified mutation in the krt5 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to naegeli-franceschetti-jadassohn syndrome/dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis ?,"nfjs/dpr results from mutations in the krt14 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 14. keratins are tough, fibrous proteins that provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). researchers believe that keratin 14 may also play a role in the formation of sweat glands and the development of dermatoglyphs.  the krt14 gene mutations that cause nfjs/dpr most likely reduce the amount of functional keratin 14 that is produced in cells. a shortage of this protein makes cells in the epidermis more likely to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). the resulting loss of these cells alters the normal development and structure of ectodermal tissues, which likely underlies most of the skin and nail problems characteristic of nfjs/dpr. however, it is unclear how a shortage of keratin 14 is related to changes in skin pigmentation."
what is (are) interstitial cystitis ?,"interstitial cystitis (ic) is a condition that causes discomfort or pain in the bladder and a need to urinate frequently and urgently. it is far more common in women than in men. the symptoms vary from person to person. some people may have pain without urgency or frequency. others have urgency and frequency without pain. women's symptoms often get worse during their periods. they may also have pain with sexual intercourse.    the cause of ic isn't known. there is no one test to tell if you have it. doctors often run tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. there is no cure for ic, but treatments can help most people feel better. they include       - distending, or inflating, the bladder    - bathing the inside of the bladder with a drug solution    - oral medicines    - electrical nerve stimulation    - physical therapy    - lifestyle changes    - bladder training    - in rare cases, surgery       nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"

how to prevent parasites - toxoplasmosis (toxoplasma infection) ?,"people who are healthy should follow the guidelines below to reduce risk of toxoplasmosis. if you have a weakened immune system, please see guidelines for immunocompromised persons.
   reduce risk from food
   
to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food:
   
    - freeze meat for several days at sub-zero (0° f) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection.
    - peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. 
     
      
     
    - wash cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables.
   
   
more on: handwashing
   
the u.s. government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce t. gondii in meat.
   reduce risk from the environment
   
to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment:
   
    - avoid drinking untreated drinking water.
    - wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain toxoplasma. wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand.
    - teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
    - keep outdoor sandboxes covered. 
     
      
     
    - feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats.
    - change the litter box daily if you own a cat. the toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until 1 to 5 days after it is shed in a cat's feces. if you are pregnant or immunocompromised: 
     
      - avoid changing cat litter if possible. if no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards.
      - keep cats indoors.
      - do not adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens. do not get a new cat while you are pregnant."
what is (are) centronuclear myopathy ?,"centronuclear myopathy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) and wasting (atrophy) in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. the severity of centronuclear myopathy varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.  people with centronuclear myopathy begin experiencing muscle weakness at any time from birth to early adulthood. the muscle weakness slowly worsens over time and can lead to delayed development of motor skills, such as crawling or walking; muscle pain during exercise; and difficulty walking. some affected individuals may need wheelchair assistance as the muscles atrophy and weakness becomes more severe. in rare instances, the muscle weakness improves over time.  some people with centronuclear myopathy experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing. people with centronuclear myopathy may have droopy eyelids (ptosis) and weakness in other facial muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. people with this condition may also have foot abnormalities, a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). rarely, individuals with centronuclear myopathy have a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), or intellectual disability.  a key feature of centronuclear myopathy is the displacement of the nucleus in muscle cells, which can be viewed under a microscope. normally the nucleus is found at the edges of the rod-shaped muscle cells, but in people with centronuclear myopathy the nucleus is located in the center of these cells. how the change in location of the nucleus affects muscle cell function is unknown."

- make it hard to swallow both solid food and liquids  - cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea  - make it hard to keep your blood glucose under control
                
your doctor or dietitian may advise you to eat smaller, more frequent meals; avoid fatty foods; and eat less fiber.
                
sex organs. damage to nerves in the sex organs may
                
- prevent a mans penis from getting firm when he wants to have sex, called erectile dysfunction or impotence. many men who have had diabetes for several years have impotence.  - prevent a womans vagina from getting wet when she wants to have sex. a woman might also have less feeling around her vagina.
                
bladder. damage to nerves in your bladder may make it hard to know when you need to urinate and when your bladder is empty. this damage can cause you to hold urine for too long, which can lead to bladder infections. you also might leak drops of urine.
                

                
sweat glands. damage to nerves in your sweat glands may prevent them from working properly. nerve damage can cause you to sweat a lot at night or while eating.
                
eyes. damage to nerves in your pupils, the parts of your eyes that react to changes in light and darkness, may make them slow to respond to these changes. you may have trouble seeing the lights of other cars when driving at night. your eyes may take longer to adjust when you enter a dark room.
                

                
heart rate and blood pressure. damage to nerves that control your heart rate and blood pressure may make these nerves respond more slowly to changes in position, stress, physical activity, sleep, and breathing patterns. you might feel dizzy or pass out when you go from lying down to standing up or when you do physical activity. you also might have shortness of breath or swelling in your feet.
                

                
ability to sense low blood glucose. autonomic nerves also let you know when your blood glucose is low. damage to these nerves can prevent you from feeling the symptoms of low blood glucose, also called hypoglycemia. this kind of nerve damage is more likely to happen if you have had diabetes for a long time or if your blood glucose has often been too low. low blood glucose can make you
                
- hungry  - dizzy or shaky  - confused  - pale  - sweat more  - weak  - anxious or cranky  - have headaches  - have a fast heartbeat
                
severe hypoglycemia can cause you to pass out. if that happens, youll need help bringing your blood glucose level back to normal. your health care team can teach your family members and friends how to give you an injection of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels quickly. if glucagon is not available, someone should call 911 to get you to the nearest emergency room for treatment.
                

                
consider wearing a diabetes medical alert identification bracelet or necklace. if you have hypoglycemia and are not able to communicate, the emergency team will know you have diabetes and get you the proper treatment. you can find these bracelets or necklaces at your pharmacy or on the internet. you can also ask your doctor for information on available products.

what are the genetic changes related to bradyopsia ?,"bradyopsia can be caused by mutations in the rgs9 gene or in the rgs9bp gene (which is also known as r9ap). these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for normal vision. the proteins are found in light-detecting cells in the eye called photoreceptors. when light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in these cells. this stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. the rgs9 and rgs9bp proteins play an essential role in returning photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.  mutations in either the rgs9 or rgs9bp gene prevent photoreceptors from recovering quickly after responding to light. normally they return to their resting state in a fraction of a second, but in people with mutations in one of these genes, it can take ten seconds or longer. during that time, the photoreceptors cannot respond to light. this delay causes temporary blindness in response to changing light conditions and interferes with seeing small objects when they are in motion.  in some people with bradyopsia, no mutations in the rgs9 or rgs9bp gene have been found. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for kennedy's disease ?,"the ninds supports a broad spectrum of research on motor neuron diseases, such as kennedy's disease. much of this research is aimed at increasing scientific understanding of these diseases and, ultimately, finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
what is (are) juvenile hyaline fibromatosis ?,"juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a disorder that affects the skin, joints, and bones. individuals with this condition typically begin to develop signs and symptoms within the first few years of life. juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is characterized by skin bumps that frequently appear on the hands, neck, scalp, ears, and nose. these skin bumps can also develop in joint creases and the genital region. they vary in size and are sometimes painful. affected individuals usually develop more skin bumps over time.  juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is also characterized by overgrowth of the gums (gingival hypertrophy) and joint deformities (contractures) that can impair movement. in addition, affected individuals may grow slowly and have bone abnormalities. people with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis typically have severe physical limitations, but most individuals have normal intelligence and live into adulthood."
what are the genetic changes related to opitz g/bbb syndrome ?,"x-linked opitz g/bbb syndrome is caused by mutations in the mid1 gene. the mid1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called midline-1. this protein attaches (binds) to microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration). midline-1 assists in recycling certain proteins that need to be reused instead of broken down. mid1 gene mutations lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents protein recycling. the resulting accumulation of proteins impairs microtubule function, leading to problems with cell division and migration. it is unclear how these changes disrupt normal development and cause the signs and symptoms of opitz g/bbb syndrome.  autosomal dominant opitz g/bbb syndrome is caused by changes in chromosome 22. some affected individuals have a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, specifically at an area of the chromosome designated 22q11.2. because this same region is deleted in another condition called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, researchers often consider opitz/gbbb syndrome caused by this genetic change to be a form of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. it is not known which of the deleted genes contribute to the signs and symptoms of opitz g/bbb syndrome.  in other people, autosomal dominant opitz/gbbb syndrome is caused by a mutation in the specc1l gene, which is near the 22q11.2 region but is not in the area that is typically deleted in other individuals with autosomal dominant opitz g/bbb syndrome or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. the specc1l gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytospin-a. this protein interacts with components of the cytoskeleton and stabilizes microtubules, which is necessary for these fibers to regulate various cell processes including the movement of cells to their proper location (cell migration). cytospin-a is particularly involved in the migration of cells that will form the facial features. mutations in the specc1l gene result in the production of a protein with a decreased ability to interact with components of the cytoskeleton. as a result, microtubules are disorganized and cells have trouble migrating to their proper location. because the specc1l gene plays a role in facial development, mutations in this gene likely account for the cleft lip and palate seen in some individuals with opitz g/bbb syndrome, but it is unclear how specc1l gene mutations cause the other features of this disorder.  some people with opitz g/bbb syndrome do not have any of the genetic changes described above. the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown."

what are the symptoms of harrod doman keele syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of harrod doman keele syndrome? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for harrod doman keele syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal nasal morphology 90% abnormality of the palate 90% abnormality of the pinna 90% abnormality of the teeth 90% arachnodactyly 90% cognitive impairment 90% hypotelorism 90% intrauterine growth retardation 90% long face 90% microcephaly 90% narrow face 90% narrow mouth 90% pointed chin 90% abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 50% abnormality of the shoulder 50% cataract 50% cerebral cortical atrophy 50% cryptorchidism 50% displacement of the external urethral meatus 50% hypopigmented skin patches 50% joint hypermobility 50% kyphosis 50% multicystic kidney dysplasia 50% scoliosis 50% seizures 50% abnormal facial shape - aganglionic megacolon - dental malocclusion - external genital hypoplasia - failure to thrive - high palate - hypospadias - intellectual disability - long nose - macrotia - malrotation of small bowel - pyloric stenosis - renal cortical microcysts - varicose veins - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) critical congenital heart disease ?,"critical congenital heart disease (cchd) is a term that refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth. these abnormalities result from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the early stages of embryonic development. cchd prevents the heart from pumping blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. as a result, organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen, which can lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. individuals with cchd usually require surgery soon after birth.  although babies with cchd may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. these can include an abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur), rapid breathing (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), and a blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis). if untreated, cchd can lead to shock, coma, and death. however, most people with cchd now survive past infancy due to improvements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.  some people with treated cchd have few related health problems later in life. however, long-term effects of cchd can include delayed development and reduced stamina during exercise. adults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.  each of the heart defects associated with cchd affects the flow of blood into, out of, or through the heart. some of the heart defects involve structures within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart. others affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). still others involve a combination of these structural abnormalities.  people with cchd have one or more specific heart defects. the heart defects classified as cchd include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right ventricle, d-transposition of the great arteries, ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus."
is hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited ?,"is hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited? hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius is inherited in an x-linked recessive manner. a condition is x-linked if the responsible gene is located on the x chromosome. the x chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the y chromosome). females have two x chromosomes in each cell and males have an x chromosome and a y chromosome in each cell. although females have two x chromosomes, one of the x chromosomes in each cell is ""turned off"" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. females who have a change (mutation) in a gene on one of their x chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because the x chromosome with the mutated gene is often turned off and they have another x chromosome with a working copy of the gene. sometimes, the x chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. however, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. a male has only one x chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the x chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected). males with an x-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers. a male cannot pass an x-linked gene to his sons because males always pass their y chromosome to male offspring. female carriers of an x-linked recessive condition have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter like themselves, a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have an affected son, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. this also means that each daughter of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of being a carrier, and each son has a 50% chance of having the condition."
what are the treatments for urinary tract infection in adults ?,"most utis are caused by bacteria, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials. the choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. some antibiotics may be ruled out if a person has allergies to them. the sensitivity test takes 48 hours to complete and is especially useful in helping the health care provider select the antibiotic most likely to be effective in treating an infection. longer treatment may be needed if the first antibiotic given is not effective.
                
when a uti occurs in a healthy person with a normal, unobstructed urinary tract, the term uncomplicated is used to describe the infection. most young women who have utis have uncomplicated utis, which can be cured with 2 or 3 days of treatment. single-dose treatment is less effective. longer treatment causes more side effects and is not more effective. a follow-up urinalysis helps to confirm the urinary tract is infection-free. taking the full course of treatment is important because symptoms may disappear before the infection is fully cleared.
                
complicated utis occur when a personfor example, a pregnant woman or a transplant patientis weakened by another condition. a uti is also complicated when the person has a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract, such as an obstructive kidney stone or prostate enlargement that squeezes the urethra. health care providers should assume that men and boys have a complicated uti until proven otherwise.
                
severely ill patients with kidney infections may be hospitalized until they can take fluids and needed medications on their own. kidney infections may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. kidney infections in adults rarely lead to kidney damage or kidney failure unless they go untreated or are associated with urinary tract obstruction.
                
bladder infections are generally self-limiting, but antibiotic treatment significantly shortens the duration of symptoms. people usually feel better within a day or two of treatment. symptoms of kidney and prostate infections last longer. drinking lots of fluids and urinating frequently will speed healing. if needed, various medications are available to relieve the pain of a uti. a heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.
                
recurrent infections in women
                
health care providers may advise women who have recurrent utis to try one of the following treatment options:
                
- take low doses of the prescribed antibiotic daily for 6 months or longer. if taken at bedtime, the medication remains in the bladder longer and may be more effective. nih-supported research has shown this therapy to be effective without causing serious side effects.  - take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual intercourse.  - take a short course2 or 3 daysof an antibiotic when symptoms appear.
                
to try to prevent an infection, health care providers may suggest women
                
- drink plenty of water every day  - urinate when the need arises and avoid resisting the urge to urinate  - urinate after sexual intercourse  - switch to a different method of birth control if recurring utis are a problem
                
infections during pregnancy
                
during pregnancy, bacterial infection of the urineeven in the absence of symptomscan pose risks to both the mother and the baby. some antibiotics are not safe to take during pregnancy. in selecting the best treatments, health care providers consider various factors such as the medications effectiveness, the stage of pregnancy, the mothers health, and potential effects on the fetus.
                
complicated infections
                
curing infections that stem from a urinary obstruction or other systemic disorder depends on finding and correcting the underlying problem, sometimes with surgery. if the root cause goes untreated, this group of patients is at risk for kidney damage. also, such infections tend to arise from a wider range of bacteria and sometimes from more than one type of bacteria at a time.
                
infections in men
                
urinary tract infections in men are often the result of an obstructionfor example, a urinary stone or enlarged prostateor are from a catheter used during a medical procedure. the first step in treating such an infection is to identify the infecting organism and the medications to which it is sensitive.
                
prostate infectionschronic bacterial prostatitisare harder to cure because antibiotics may be unable to penetrate infected prostate tissue effectively. for this reason, men with bacterial prostatitis often need long-term treatment with a carefully selected antibiotic. utis in men are frequently associated with acute bacterial prostatitis, which can be life threatening if not treated urgently."
what are the treatments for dermatitis herpetiformis: skin manifestation of celiac disease (for health care professionals) ?,"the sulfone dapsone can provide immediate relief of symptoms. for patients who cannot tolerate dapsone, sulfapyridine or sulfamethoxypyridazine may be used, although these medications are less effective than dapsone. a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for the underlying disease. even with a gluten-free diet, medication therapy may need to be continued from a few months to 2 years.
                
dh can go into remission, which is defined as absence of skin lesions and symptoms of dh for more than 2 years while not taking sulfones or other treatments and not adhering to a gluten-free diet. cohort studies showing dh remission provide support for reducing sulfone therapy and weaning from a gluten-free diet in patients with well-controlled dh.6"
what is (are) overview of kidney disease in children ?,"the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. the kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do. ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder. the bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate.
                
the kidney is not one large filter. each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. each nephron filters a small amount of blood. the nephron includes a filter, called a glomerulus, and a tubule. the nephrons work through a two-step process. the glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. the filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which changes the fluid by sending needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removing wastes. the final product becomes urine.
                
the kidneys also control the level of minerals such as sodium, phosphorus, and potassium in the body, and produce an important hormone to prevent anemia. anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is less than normal, resulting in less oxygen carried to the bodys cells."
what are the genetic changes related to oral-facial-digital syndrome ?,"only one gene, ofd1, has been associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome. mutations in this gene cause oral-facial-digital syndrome type i. ofd1 gene mutations were also found in an affected family whose disorder was classified as type vii; however, researchers now believe that type vii is the same as type i.  the ofd1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not fully understood. it appears to play an important role in the early development of many parts of the body, including the brain, face, limbs, and kidneys. mutations in the ofd1 gene prevent cells from making enough functional ofd1 protein, which disrupts the normal development of these structures. it is unclear how a shortage of this protein causes the specific features of oral-facial-digital syndrome type i.  researchers are actively searching for the genetic changes responsible for the other forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome."
how many people are affected by turner syndrome ?,"this condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 newborn girls worldwide, but it is much more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths)."
what is (are) proud syndrome ?,"proud syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is primarily characterized by severe intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, seizures, and spasticity. it usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. proud syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the arx gene and is inherited in an x-linked recessive manner. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."
what is (are) autosomal recessive primary microcephaly ?,"autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (often shortened to mcph, which stands for ""microcephaly primary hereditary"") is a condition in which infants are born with a very small head and a small brain. the term ""microcephaly"" comes from the greek words for ""small head.""  infants with mcph have an unusually small head circumference compared to other infants of the same sex and age. head circumference is the distance around the widest part of the head, measured by placing a measuring tape above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head. affected infants' brain volume is also smaller than usual, although they usually do not have any major abnormalities in the structure of the brain. the head and brain grow throughout childhood and adolescence, but they continue to be much smaller than normal.  mcph causes intellectual disability, which is typically mild to moderate and does not become more severe with age. most affected individuals have delayed speech and language skills. motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking, may also be mildly delayed.  people with mcph usually have few or no other features associated with the condition. some have a narrow, sloping forehead; mild seizures; problems with attention or behavior; or short stature compared to others in their family. the condition typically does not affect any other major organ systems or cause other health problems."
what is the outlook for trigeminal neuralgia ?,"the disorder is characterized by recurrences and remissions, and successive recurrences may incapacitate the patient. due to the intensity of the pain, even the fear of an impending attack may prevent activity. trigeminal neuralgia is not fatal."
what are the treatments for factor v deficiency ?,how is factor v deficiency treated? resources state that fresh plasma or fresh frozen plasma infusions will correct the deficiency temporarily and may be administered daily during a bleeding episode or after surgery.  individuals with factor v deficiency should discuss treatment options with their primary health care provider and a hematologist.
do you have information about gun safety,"summary : many u.s. households have guns, but they can cause harm if not handled properly. here are some things you can do to keep yourself and your family safe:       - teach children that they shouldn't touch guns and that if they see a gun, to leave it alone and tell an adult.     - if your children play at another home, talk to the parents about gun safety.     - treat every gun as if it were loaded.     - always store guns unloaded.     - lock guns in a rack or safe, and hide the keys or combination.     - store ammunition away from guns and keep it locked.     - don't keep guns in your home if someone in your family has a mental illness, severe depression, or potential for violence."
what is (are) adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?,"adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that appears in late childhood or adolescence. instead of growing straight, the spine develops a side-to-side curvature, usually in an elongated ""s"" or ""c"" shape, and the bones of the spine become slightly twisted or rotated. in many cases, the abnormal spinal curve is stable; however, in some children, the curve becomes more severe over time (progressive). for unknown reasons, severe and progressive curves occur more frequently in girls than in boys. the cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is unknown. it is likely that there are both genetic and environmental factors involved. treatment may include observation, bracing and/or surgery."
what are the genetic changes related to atelosteogenesis type 1 ?,"mutations in the flnb gene cause atelosteogenesis type 1. the flnb gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin b. this protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin b attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. filamin b also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development.  filamin b is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. it is active (expressed) in the cell membranes of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. most cartilage is later converted to bone, a process called ossification, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears. filamin b appears to be important for normal cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage.  flnb gene mutations that cause atelosteogenesis type 1 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin b protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. this abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with the proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 1."
what is (are) myh-associated polyposis ?,"myh-associated polyposis is an inherited condition characterized by the development of multiple adenomatous colon polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. this condition, a milder form of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap), is sometimes called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis because it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. people with this condition have fewer polyps than those with the classic type of fap; fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or thousands. they may also be at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal polyps. myh-associated polyposis is caused by mutations in the myh gene."
what are the treatments for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ?,"how might fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva be treated? there is currently no definitive treatment.  however, a brief course of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, started within the first 24 hours of a flare-up, may help reduce the intense inflammation and tissue swelling seen in the early stages of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.  other medications, such as muscle relaxants, mast cell inhibitors, and aminobisphosphonates, if appropriate, should be closely monitored by a physician.  surgery to remove heterotopic and extra-skeletal bone is risky and can potentially cause painful new bone growth."
what is (are) steatocystoma multiplex ?,"steatocystoma multiplex is a condition characterized by numerous skin cysts that tend to develop during puberty. cysts most often develop on the chest, upper arms and face, but may develop all over the body in some cases. the cysts may become inflamed and cause scarring when they heal. the condition is thought to be caused by mutations in the krt17 gene and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. some researchers have suggested that the condition may be a mild variant of pachyonychia congenita type 2. treatment may include minor surgery to remove cysts and oral antibiotics or oral isotretinoin to reduce inflammation."
what is (are) vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,"vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. this disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. the macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.  vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. as a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night.  researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. the early-onset form (known as best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. the adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. the two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination."
what are the symptoms of breast cancer ?,"when breast cancer first develops, there may be no symptoms at all. but as the cancer grows, it can cause changes that women should watch for. you can help safeguard your health by learning the following warning signs of breast cancer. -  a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area  - a change in the size or shape of the breast  - a dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast  -  a nipple turned inward into the breast  -  fluid, other than breast milk, from the nipple, especially if it's bloody  - scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple)  - dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange. a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area a change in the size or shape of the breast a dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast a nipple turned inward into the breast fluid, other than breast milk, from the nipple, especially if it's bloody scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple) dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange. don't ignore symptoms you should see your doctor about any symptoms like these. most often, they are not cancer, but it's important to check with the doctor so that any problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. some women believe that as they age, health problems are due to ""growing older."" because of this myth, many illnesses go undiagnosed and untreated. don't ignore your symptoms because you think they are not important or because you believe they are normal for your age. talk to your doctor."
what is (are) osteochondritis dissecans ?,"osteochondritis dissecans is a joint condition that occurs when a piece of cartilage and the thin layer of bone beneath it, separates from the end of the bone. if the piece of cartilage and bone remain close to where they detached, they may not cause any symptoms. however, affected people may experience pain, weakness and/or decreased range of motion in the affected joint if the cartilage and bone travel into the joint space. although osteochondritis dissecans can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed in people between the ages of 10 and 20 years. in most cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member (called familial osteochondritis dissecans); in these cases, osteochondritis dissecans is caused by changes (mutations) in the acan gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. treatment for the condition varies depending on many factors, including the age of the affected person and the severity of the symptoms, but may include rest; casting or splinting; surgery and/or physical therapy."
what is (are) acute myeloid leukemia ?,"leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. white blood cells help your body fight infection. your blood cells form in your bone marrow. in leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. these cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. in acute myeloid leukemia (aml), there are too many of a specific type of white blood cell called a myeloblast.    aml is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. this type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. possible risk factors include smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation.     symptoms of aml include:       - fever    - shortness of breath    - easy bruising or bleeding    - bleeding under the skin    - weakness or feeling tired    - weight loss or loss of appetite       tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose aml. treatments include chemotherapy, other drugs, radiation therapy, stem cell transplants, and targeted therapy. targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. once the leukemia is in remission, you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.    nih: national cancer institute"
what are the genetic changes related to pilomatricoma ?,"mutations in the ctnnb1 gene are found in almost all cases of isolated pilomatricoma. these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells. somatic mutations are not inherited.  the ctnnb1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-catenin. this protein plays an important role in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) and in communication between cells. it is also involved in cell signaling as part of the wnt signaling pathway. this pathway promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and helps determine the specialized functions a cell will have (differentiation). wnt signaling is involved in many aspects of development before birth, as well as the maintenance and repair of adult tissues.  among its many activities, beta-catenin appears to be necessary for the normal function of hair follicles. this protein is active in cells that make up a part of the hair follicle known as the matrix. these cells divide and mature to form the different components of the hair follicle and the hair shaft. as matrix cells divide, the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin.  mutations in the ctnnb1 gene lead to a version of beta-catenin that is always turned on (constitutively active). the overactive protein triggers matrix cells to divide too quickly and in an uncontrolled way, leading to the formation of a pilomatricoma.  most pilomatrix carcinomas, the malignant version of pilomatricoma, also have somatic mutations in the ctnnb1 gene. it is unclear why some pilomatricomas are cancerous but most others are not."
what to do for porphyria ?,"people with an acute porphyria should eat a diet with an average-to-high level of carbohydrates. the recommended dietary allowance for carbohydrates is 130 g per day for adults and children 1 year of age or older; pregnant and breastfeeding women need higher intakes.2 people should avoid limiting intake of carbohydrates and calories, even for short periods of time, as this type of dieting or fasting can trigger symptoms. people with an acute porphyria who want to lose weight should talk with their health care providers about diets they can follow to lose weight gradually.
                
people undergoing therapeutic phlebotomies should drink plenty of milk, water, or juice before and after each procedure.
                
a health care provider may recommend vitamin and mineral supplements for people with a cutaneous porphyria."
how to diagnose primary sclerosing cholangitis ?,"blood tests to check levels of liver enzymes are the first step in diagnosing psc. doctors confirm the diagnosis using cholangiography, which provides pictures of the bile ducts.
                
cholangiography can be performed in the following ways:
                
-  endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). ercp uses an endoscopea long, flexible, lighted tubethat goes down the mouth, beyond the stomach, and into the duodenum to reach an area in the digestive tract where dye can be injected into the bile ducts. x rays are taken when the dye is injected. ercp also can be used to take a tissue sample or to treat blocked ducts. more information about ercp is provided in the niddk health topic, ercp (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography).  -  percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. this procedure involves inserting a needle through the skin and placing a thin tube into a duct in the liver. dye is injected through the tube and x rays are taken.  -  magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (mrcp). mrcp uses magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to obtain pictures of the bile ducts. mri machines use radio waves and magnets to scan internal organs and tissues. mrcp does not involve using x rays or inserting instruments into the body. this safe and painless test is increasingly used for diagnosis.
                
other testing may include ultrasound exams and a liver biopsy. ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of organs inside the body. a biopsy involves removal of a small piece of tissue for examination with a microscope."
is von hippel-lindau disease inherited ?,"how is von hippel-lindau (vhl) disease inherited? mutations in the gene that causes vhl disease (the vhl gene) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having a mutation in only one copy of the vhl gene in each cell is enough to increase a person's risk of developing vhl disease. in most autosomal dominant conditions, having one mutated copy of the responsible gene is sufficient to cause the condition. however, in vhl disease, a mutation in the other copy of the gene must occur (during a person's lifetime) to trigger the development of vhl disease. for example, a person may inherit a mutated copy of the gene from a parent, but acquiring a second mutation in the other gene copy in a specific organ may trigger tumor development in that organ. almost everyone who is born with one vhl mutation will eventually acquire a mutation in the second copy of the gene and develop vhl disease. in most cases, an affected person inherits the first mutated gene from an affected parent. however, in about 20% of cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. this is called a de novo mutation. when a person with a mutation that can lead to vhl disease has children, each of their children has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation."
who is at risk for oxygen therapy? ?,"oxygen therapy can cause complications and side effects. these problems might include a dry or bloody nose, skin irritation from the nasal cannula or face mask, fatigue (tiredness), and morning headaches.
                
if these problems persist, tell your doctor and home equipment provider. depending on the problem, your doctor may need to change your oxygen flow rate or the length of time you're using the oxygen.
                
if nose dryness is a problem, your doctor may recommend a nasal spray or have a humidifier added to your oxygen equipment.
                
if you have an uncomfortable nasal cannula or face mask, your home equipment provider can help you find a device that fits better. your provider also can recommend over-the-counter gels and devices that are designed to lessen skin irritation.
                
complications from transtracheal oxygen therapy can be more serious. with this type of oxygen therapy, oxygen is delivered through a tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck.
                
with transtracheal oxygen therapy:
                
mucus balls might develop on the tube inside the windpipe. mucus balls tend to form as a result of the oxygen drying out the airways. mucus balls can cause coughing and clog the windpipe or tube.
                
problems with the tube slipping or breaking.
                
infection.
                
injury to the lining of the windpipe.
                
proper medical care and correct handling of the tube and other supplies may reduce the risk of complications.
                
other risks
                
in certain people, oxygen therapy may suppress the drive to breathe, affecting how well the respiratory system works. this is managed by adjusting the oxygen flow rate.
                
oxygen poses a fire risk, so you'll need to take certain safety steps. oxygen itself isn't explosive, but it can worsen a fire. in the presence of oxygen, a small fire can quickly get out of control. also, the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in might explode if exposed to heat.
                
your home equipment provider will give you a complete list of safety steps you'll need to take at home and when out in public.
                
for example, when you're not using the oxygen, keep it in an airy room. never store compressed oxygen gas cylinders and liquid oxygen containers in small, enclosed places, such as in closets, behind curtains, or under clothes.
                
oxygen containers let off small amounts of oxygen. these small amounts can build up to harmful levels if they're allowed to escape into small spaces."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for ataxia telangiectasia ?,"ninds-supported researchers discovered the gene responsible for a-t, known as atm (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) in 1995. this gene makes a protein that activates many (probably more than 700) other proteins that control cell cycle, dna repair, and cell death. without it, cells are unable to activate the cellular checkpoints that protect against the damage of ionizing radiation and other agents that can harm dna. in addition to supporting basic research on a-t, ninds also funds research aimed at a-t drug development, including development of animal models, gene and stem-cell based therapies, and high-throughput drug screens. the ninds also leads a trans-nih a-t working group whose members include ninds, nhlbi, niehs, nci, nei, nigms, nhgri, nia, niaid, nichd, and ord."
what are the treatments for pigmented villonodular synovitis ?,"how might pigmented villonodular synovitis be treated? pigmented villonodular synovitis is first treated with surgery to remove as much of the abnormal tissue growth as possible.  the type of surgery depends on the location and extent of the disease within the joint.  radiation therapy is sometimes used to treat this condition if surgery is not an option, or if the condition returns (recurs) after an initial surgery."
what are the symptoms of glomerulonephritis with sparse hair and telangiectases ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis with sparse hair and telangiectases? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for glomerulonephritis with sparse hair and telangiectases. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) absent eyebrow - absent eyelashes - alopecia - autosomal dominant inheritance - decreased subcutaneous fat - epicanthus - epidermal hyperkeratosis - facial telangiectasia in butterfly midface distribution - hydrocele testis - hypotrichosis - long nose - mandibular prognathia - membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis - oval face - palpebral edema - prominent nasal bridge - reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue - renal insufficiency - sparse eyebrow - sparse eyelashes - telangiectasia of extensor surfaces - thick vermilion border - wide nasal bridge - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ?,"greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (gcps) is a congenital disorder that affects development of the limbs, head, and face. findings might include an extra finger or toe (polydactyly), fusion of the skin between the fingers or toes (syndactyly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), and an abnormally large head size (macrocephaly).the features of this syndrome are highly variable, ranging from polydactyly and syndactyly of the upper and/or lower limbs to seizure, hydrocephalus , and intellectual disability. progression of gcps is dependent on severity. greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome is caused by mutations in the gli3 gene. this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. treatment is symptomatic."
what are the treatments for urinary incontinence in men ?,"treatment depends on the type of ui.
                
urgency incontinence
                
as a first line of therapy for urgency incontinence, a health care professional may recommend the following techniques to treat a mans problem:
                
- behavioral and lifestyle changes  - bladder training  - pelvic floor exercises  - urgency suppression
                
if those treatments are not successful, the following additional measures may help urgency incontinence:
                
- medications  - electrical nerve stimulation  - bulking agents  - surgery
                
a health care professional may recommend other treatments for men with urgency incontinence caused by bph. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
behavioral and lifestyle changes. men with urgency incontinence may be able to reduce leaks by making behavioral and lifestyle changes:
                
- eating, diet, and nutrition. men with urgency incontinence can change the amount and type of liquid they drink. a man can try limiting bladder irritantsincluding caffeinated drinks such as tea or coffee and carbonated beveragesto decrease leaks. men also should limit alcoholic drinks, which can increase urine production. a health care professional can help a man determine how much he should drink based on his health, how active he is, and where he lives. to decrease nighttime trips to the restroom, men may want to stop drinking liquids several hours before bed.  - engaging in physical activity. although a man may be reluctant to engage in physical activity when he has urgency incontinence, regular exercise is important for good overall health and for preventing and treating ui.  - losing weight. men who are overweight should talk with a health care professional about strategies for losing weight, which can help improve ui.  - preventing constipation. gastrointestinal (gi) problems, especially constipation, can make urinary tract health worse and can lead to ui. the opposite is also true: urinary problems, such as ui, can make gi problems worse. more information about how to prevent constipation through diet and physical activity is provided in the niddk health topic, constipation.
                

                
to help prevent bladder problems, stop smoking   people who smoke should stop. quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health. smoking increases a persons chance of developing stress incontinence, as it increases coughing. some people say smoking worsens their bladder irritation. smoking causes most cases of bladder cancer. people who smoke for many years have a higher risk of bladder cancer than nonsmokers or those who smoke for a short time.2 people who smoke should ask for help so they do not have to try quitting alone. call 1-800-quitnow (1-800-784-8669) for more information.
                
bladder training. bladder training is changing urination habits to decrease incidents of ui. the health care professional may suggest a man use the restroom at regular timed intervals, called timed voiding, based on the mans bladder diary. a man can gradually lengthen the time between trips to the restroom to help stretch the bladder so it can hold more urine.
                
pelvic floor muscle exercises. pelvic floor muscle, or kegel, exercises involve strengthening pelvic floor muscles. strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine more effectively than weak muscles. a man does not need special equipment for kegel exercises. the exercises involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow. pelvic floor exercises should not be performed during urination. a health care professional can help a man learn proper technique. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, kegel exercise tips.
                
men also may learn how to perform kegel exercises properly by using biofeedback. biofeedback uses special sensors to measure bodily functions, such as muscle contractions that control urination. a video monitor displays the measurements as graphs, and sounds indicate when the man is using the correct muscles. the health care professional uses the information to help the man change abnormal function of the pelvic floor muscles. at home, the man practices to improve muscle function. the man can perform the exercises while lying down, sitting at a desk, or standing up. success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of ui, its severity, and the mans ability to perform the exercises.
                
urgency suppression. by using certain techniques, a man can suppress the urge to urinate, called urgency suppression. urgency suppression is a way for a man to train his bladder to maintain control so he does not have to panic about finding a restroom. some men use distraction techniques to take their mind off the urge to urinate. other men find taking long, relaxing breaths and being still can help. doing pelvic floor exercises also can help suppress the urge to urinate.
                
medications. health care professionals may prescribe medications that relax the bladder, decrease bladder spasms, or treat prostate enlargement to treat urgency incontinence in men.
                
- antimuscarinics. antimuscarinics can help relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms. these medications include oxybutynin (oxytrol), tolterodine (detrol), darifenacin (enablex), trospium (sanctura), fesoterodine (toviaz), and solifenacin (vesicare). they are available in pill, liquid, and patch form.  - tricyclic antidepressants. tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (tofranil) can calm nerve signals, decreasing spasms in bladder muscles.  - alpha-blockers. terazosin (hytrin), doxazosin (cardura), tamsulosin (flomax), alfuzosin (uroxatral), and silodosin (rapaflo) are used to treat problems caused by prostate enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction. these medications relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, which lets urine flow normally and prevents abnormal bladder contractions that can lead to urgency incontinence.  - 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. finasteride (proscar) and dutasteride (avodart) block the production of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone, which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth. these medications may help to relieve urgency incontinence problems by shrinking an enlarged prostate.  - beta-3 agonists. mirabegron (myrbetriq) is a beta-3 agonist a person takes by mouth to help prevent symptoms of urgency incontinence. mirabegron suppresses involuntary bladder contractions.  - botox. a health care professional may use onabotulinumtoxina (botox), also called botulinum toxin type a, to treat ui in men with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. injecting botox into the bladder relaxes the bladder, increasing storage capacity and decreasing ui. a health care professional performs the procedure during an office visit. a man receives local anesthesia. the health care professional uses a cystoscope to guide the needle for injecting the botox. botox is effective for up to 10 months.3
                
electrical nerve stimulation. if behavioral and lifestyle changes and medications do not improve symptoms, a urologist may suggest electrical nerve stimulation as an option to prevent ui, urinary frequencyurination more often than normaland other symptoms. electrical nerve stimulation involves altering bladder reflexes using pulses of electricity. the two most common types of electrical nerve stimulation are percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation and sacral nerve stimulation.4
                
- percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation uses electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve, which is located in the ankle, on a weekly basis. the patient receives local anesthesia for the procedure. in an outpatient center, a urologist inserts a battery-operated stimulator beneath the skin near the tibial nerve. electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve prevents bladder activity by interfering with the pathway between the bladder and the spinal cord or brain. although researchers consider percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation safe, they continue to study the exact ways that it prevents symptoms and how long the treatment can last.  - sacral nerve stimulation involves implanting a battery-operated stimulator beneath the skin in the lower back near the sacral nerve. the procedure takes place in an outpatient center using local anesthesia. based on the patients feedback, the health care professional can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that individual. the electrical pulses enter the body for minutes to hours, two or more times a day, either through wires placed on the lower back or just above the pubic areabetween the navel and the pubic hair. sacral nerve stimulation may increase blood flow to the bladder, strengthen pelvic muscles that help control the bladder, and trigger the release of natural substances that block pain. the patient can turn the stimulator on or off at any time.
                
a patient may consider getting an implanted device that delivers regular impulses to the bladder. a urologist places a wire next to the tailbone and attaches it to a permanent stimulator under the skin.
                
bulking agents. a urologist injects bulking agents, such as collagen and carbon spheres, near the urinary sphincter to treat incontinence. the bulking agent makes the tissues thicker and helps close the bladder opening. before the procedure, the health care professional may perform a skin test to make sure the man doesnt have an allergic reaction to the bulking agent. a urologist performs the procedure during an office visit. the man receives local anesthesia. the urologist uses a cystoscopea tubelike instrument used to look inside the urethra and bladderto guide the needle for injection of the bulking agent. over time, the body may slowly eliminate certain bulking agents, so a man may need to have injections again.
                
surgery. as a last resort, surgery to treat urgency incontinence in men includes the artificial urinary sphincter (aus) and the male sling. a health care professional performs the surgery in a hospital with regional or general anesthesia. most men can leave the hospital the same day, although some may need to stay overnight.
                
- aus. an aus is an implanted device that keeps the urethra closed until the man is ready to urinate. the device has three parts: a cuff that fits around the urethra, a small balloon reservoir placed in the abdomen, and a pump placed in the scrotumthe sac that holds the testicles. the cuff contains a liquid that makes it fit tightly around the urethra to prevent urine from leaking. when it is time to urinate, the man squeezes the pump with his fingers to deflate the cuff. the liquid moves to the balloon reservoir and lets urine flow through the urethra. when the bladder is empty, the cuff automatically refills in the next 2 to 5 minutes to keep the urethra tightly closed.  - male sling. a health care professional performs a sling procedure, also called urethral compression procedure, to add support to the urethra, which can sometimes better control urination. through an incision in the tissue between the scrotum and the rectum, also called the perineum, the health care professional uses a piece of human tissue or mesh to compress the urethra against the pubic bone. the surgeon secures the ends of the tissue or mesh around the pelvic bones. the lifting and compression of the urethra sometimes provides better control over urination.
                
stress incontinence
                
men who have stress incontinence can use the same techniques for treating urgency incontinence.
                
functional incontinence
                
men with functional incontinence may wear protective undergarments if they worry about reaching a restroom in time. these products include adult diapers or pads and are available from drugstores, grocery stores, and medical supply stores. men who have functional incontinence should talk to a health care professional about its cause and how to prevent or treat functional incontinence.
                
overflow incontinence
                
a health care professional treats overflow incontinence caused by a blockage in the urinary tract with surgery to remove the obstruction. men with overflow incontinence that is not caused by a blockage may need to use a catheter to empty the bladder. a catheter is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. a health care professional can teach a man how to use a catheter. a man may need to use a catheter once in a while, a few times a day, or all the time. catheters that are used continuously drain urine from the bladder into a bag that is attached to the mans thigh with a strap. men using a continuous catheter should watch for symptoms of an infection.
                
transient incontinence
                
a health care professional treats transient incontinence by addressing the underlying cause. for example, if a medication is causing increased urine production leading to ui, a health care professional may try lowering the dose or prescribing a different medication. a health care professional may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to treat utis."

what is (are) succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ssadh) deficiency is disorder that can cause a variety of neurological and neuromuscular problems. the signs and symptoms can be extremely variable among affected individuals and may include mild to severe intellectual disability; developmental delay (especially involving speech); hypotonia; difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); and/or seizures. some affected individuals may also have decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia); nystagmus; hyperactivity; and/or behavioral problems. ssadh deficiency is caused by mutations in the aldh5a1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. management is generally symptomatic and typically focuses on treating seizures and neurobehavioral issues.
how many people are affected by north american indian childhood cirrhosis ?,"north american indian childhood cirrhosis has been found only in children of ojibway-cree descent in the abitibi region of northwestern quebec, canada. at least 30 affected individuals from this population have been reported."
what is (are) glomerular diseases ?,"the two kidneys are bean-shaped organs located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. everyday, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid.
                
blood enters the kidneys through arteries that branch inside the kidneys into tiny clusters of looping blood vessels. each cluster is called a glomerulus, which comes from the greek word meaning filter. the plural form of the word is glomeruli. there are approximately 1 million glomeruli, or filters, in each kidney. the glomerulus is attached to the opening of a small fluid-collecting tube called a tubule. blood is filtered in the glomerulus, and extra fluid and wastes pass into the tubule and become urine. eventually, the urine drains from the kidneys into the bladder through larger tubes called ureters.
                
each glomerulus-and-tubule unit is called a nephron. each kidney is composed of about 1 million nephrons. in healthy nephrons, the glomerular membrane that separates the blood vessel from the tubule allows waste products and extra water to pass into the tubule while keeping blood cells and protein in the bloodstream."
what is (are) asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy ?,"asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, also known as jeune syndrome, is an inherited disorder of bone growth characterized by a narrow chest, short ribs, shortened bones in the arms and legs, short stature, and extra fingers and toes (polydactyly). additional skeletal abnormalities can include unusually shaped collarbones (clavicles) and pelvic bones, and and cone-shaped ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. many infants with this condition are born with an extremely narrow, bell-shaped chest that can restrict the growth and expansion of the lungs. life-threatening problems with breathing result, and people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy may live only into infancy or early childhood. however, in people who survive beyond the first few years, the narrow chest and related breathing problems can improve with age.  some people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy are born with less severe skeletal abnormalities and have only mild breathing difficulties, such as rapid breathing or shortness of breath. these individuals may live into adolescence or adulthood. after infancy, people with this condition may develop life-threatening kidney (renal) abnormalities that cause the kidneys to malfunction or fail. heart defects and a narrowing of the airway (subglottic stenosis) are also possible. other, less common features of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy include liver disease, fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the pancreas, dental abnormalities, and an eye disease called retinal dystrophy that can lead to vision loss."
what is (are) turner syndrome ?,"turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a girl's development. the cause is a missing or incomplete x chromosome. girls who have it are short, and their ovaries don't work properly.    other physical features typical of turner syndrome are       -  short, ""webbed"" neck with folds of skin from tops of shoulders to sides of neck    -  low hairline in the back    -  low-set ears    -  swollen hands and feet       most women with turner syndrome are infertile. they are at risk for health difficulties such as high blood pressure, kidney problems, diabetes, cataracts, osteoporosis, and thyroid problems.    doctors diagnose turner syndrome based on symptoms and a genetic test. sometimes it is found in prenatal testing. there is no cure for turner syndrome, but there are some treatments for the symptoms. growth hormone often helps girls reach heights that are close to average. hormone replacement can help start sexual development. assisted reproduction techniques can help some women with turner syndrome get pregnant.    nih: national institute of child health and human development"

what is (are) central cord syndrome ?,"central cord syndrome is the most common form of incomplete spinal cord injury characterized by impairment in the arms and hands and to a lesser extent in the legs. the brain's ability to send and receive signals to and from parts of the body below the site of injury is reduced but not entirely blocked. this syndrome is associated with damage to the large nerve fibers that carry information directly from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. these nerves are particularly important for hand and arm function. symptoms may include paralysis or loss of fine control of movements in the arms and hands, with relatively less impairment of leg movements. sensory loss below the site of the injury and loss of bladder control may also occur, as well as painful sensations such as tinging, burning, or dull ache. the overall amount and type of functional loss is dependent upon the severity of nerve damage. central cord syndrome is usually the result of trauma that causes damage to the vertebrae in the neck or herniation of the vertebral discs. it also may develop in persons over the age of 50 due to gradual weakening of the vertebrae and discs, which narrows the spinal column and may contribute to compression of the spinal cord when the neck is hyper-extended."

what causes swyer-james syndrome ?,"what causes swyer-james syndrome? the cause of swyer-james syndrome is not completely understood. most experts agree that the initial abnormality occurs in the distal bronchi (air tubes that bring air to and from the lungs) after an infection during early childhood. the smaller size of the affected lung may be due to the infection inhibiting the normal growth of the lung. a number of reports have described swyer-james syndrome following childhood histories including radiation therapy; measles; pertussis (whooping cough); tuberculosis; breathing in a foreign body; mycoplasma; and viral infections, especially adenovirus. research has suggested that a hyper-immune reaction in the lung (producing an unusual abundance of antibodies) may play a role in sustaining airway damage after the initial infection. some have argued a pre-existing lung abnormality may predispose individuals to the condition. although bronchial damage of some kind during childhood is generally considered to play an important role, many affected individuals have had no known history of an airway infection. it is possible that some unknown factors present at birth may contribute to the development of swyer-james syndrome."

what is (are) 22q13.3 deletion syndrome ?,"22q13.3 deletion syndrome, which is also commonly known as phelan-mcdermid syndrome, is a disorder caused by the loss of a small piece of chromosome 22. the deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.  the features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome vary widely and involve many parts of the body. characteristic signs and symptoms include developmental delay, moderate to profound intellectual disability, decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), and absent or delayed speech. some people with this condition have autism or autistic-like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. they may also chew on non-food items such as clothing. less frequently, people with this condition have seizures.  individuals with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome tend to have a decreased sensitivity to pain. many also have a reduced ability to sweat, which can lead to a greater risk of overheating and dehydration. some people with this condition have episodes of frequent vomiting and nausea (cyclic vomiting) and backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux).  people with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome typically have distinctive facial features, including a long, narrow head; prominent ears; a pointed chin; droopy eyelids (ptosis); and deep-set eyes. other physical features seen with this condition include large and fleshy hands and/or feet, a fusion of the second and third toes (syndactyly), and small or abnormal toenails. some affected individuals have rapid (accelerated) growth."
what are the genetic changes related to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy ?,"mutations in the pnpo gene cause pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy. the pnpo gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase. this enzyme is involved in the conversion (metabolism) of vitamin b6 derived from food (in the form of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine) to the active form of vitamin b6 called pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp). plp is necessary for many processes in the body including protein metabolism and the production of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters).  pnpo gene mutations result in a pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase enzyme that is unable to metabolize pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, leading to a deficiency of plp. a shortage of plp can disrupt the function of many other proteins and enzymes that need plp in order to be effective. it is not clear how the lack of plp affects the brain and leads to the seizures that are characteristic of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy."
what is (are) problems with smell ?,"our sense of smell helps us enjoy life. we delight in the aromas of our favorite foods or the fragrance of flowers. our sense of smell also is a warning system, alerting us to danger signals such as a gas leak, spoiled food, or a fire. any loss in our sense of smell can have a negative effect on our quality of life. it also can be a sign of more serious health problems. aging and smell loss problems with smell increase as people get older, and they are more common in men than women. in one study, nearly one-quarter of men ages 6069 had a smell disorder, while about 11 percent of women in that age range reported a problem. many older people are not even aware that they have a problem with their sense of smell because the changes occur gradually over several years. they may not even notice that they are experiencing a loss of smell until there is an incident in which they don't detect food that has spoiled or the presence of dangerous smoke. how our sense of smell works the sense of smell, or olfaction, is part of our chemical sensing system, along with the sense of taste. normal smell occurs when odors around us, like the fragrance of flowers or the smell of baking bread, stimulate the specialized sensory cells, called olfactory sensory cells. olfactory sensory cells are located in a small patch of tissue high inside the nose. odors reach the olfactory sensory cells in two pathways. the first pathway is by inhaling, or sniffing, through your nose. when people think about smell, they generally think of this pathway. the second pathway is less familiar. it is a channel that connects the roof of the throat region to the nose. when we chew our food, aromas are released that access olfactory sensory cells through this channel. if you are congested due to a head cold or sinus infection, this channel is blocked, which temporarily affects your ability to appreciate the flavors of food. types of smell disorders people who experience smell disorders either have a decrease in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors. total smell loss is relatively rare, but a decrease in the sense of smell occurs more often, especially in older adults. a decreased sense of smell may be temporary and treatable with medication. there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected. -  some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced.   - other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia.   - sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul.   - still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia.   - smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia.  some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced. other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia.  sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia.  smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia. smell loss may signal other conditions problems with our chemical senses may be a sign of other serious health conditions. a smell disorder can be an early sign of parkinsons disease, alzheimers disease, or multiple sclerosis. it can also be related to other medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and malnutrition. getting a diagnosis early will help an individual deal better with the underlying condition or disease. smell and taste smell and taste are closely linked in the brain, but are actually distinct sensory systems. true tastes are detected by taste buds on the tongue and the roof of the mouth, as well as in the throat region, and are limited to sweet, salty, sour, bitter, savory and perhaps a few other sensations. the loss of smell is much more common than the loss of taste, and many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste, when they are really experiencing a problem with their sense of smell. a loss in taste or smell is diagnosed by your doctor using special taste and smell tests. smell loss and eating habits when smell is impaired, people usually have problems appreciating the subtle flavors of food, and say that food is less enjoyable. some people change their eating habits. some may eat too little and lose weight while others may eat too much and gain weight. either way, there may be a long-term impact on one's overall health. loss of smell may also cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better. this can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. in severe cases, loss of smell can lead to depression. hazards of smell loss research shows that people with a total or partial loss of smell are almost twice as likely as people with normal smell to have certain kinds of accidents. the most common types of accidents in order of frequency involve - cooking   - eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances   - failing to detect gas leaks or fires  cooking eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances failing to detect gas leaks or fires if you think you have a problem with your sense of smell, see your doctor."

what is (are) lamellar ichthyosis ?,"lamellar ichthyosis is a condition that mainly affects the skin. infants with this condition are typically born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. this membrane usually dries and peels off during the first few weeks of life, and then it becomes obvious that affected babies have scaly skin, and eyelids and lips that are turned outward. people with lamellar ichthyosis typically have large, dark, plate-like scales covering their skin on most of their body. infants with lamellar ichthyosis may develop infections, an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration), and respiratory problems. affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia), abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy), a decreased ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), an increased sensitivity to heat, and a thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (keratoderma). less frequently, affected individuals have reddened skin (erythema) and joint deformities (contractures)."
how to diagnose breast cancer ?,"breast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.
		                    to detect breast cancer, pregnant and nursing women should examine their breasts themselves. women should also receive clinical breast exams during their regular prenatal and postnatal check-ups. talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts that you do not expect or that worry you.
		        
		        
		                    tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.
		                    the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -  clinical breast exam (cbe): an exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. the doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.     -    mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of both breasts. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the picture can be printed to look at later.    -   mammogram : an x-ray of the breast. a mammogram can be done with little risk to the unborn baby. mammograms in pregnant women may appear negative even though cancer is present.     -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. if a lump in the breast is found, a biopsy may be done. there are four types of breast biopsies:               -  excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lump of tissue.       -  incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.       -  core biopsy : the removal of tissue using a wide needle.       -  fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : the removal of tissue or fluid, using a thin needle.
		        
		        
		                    if cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.
		                    decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests and the age of the unborn baby. the tests give information about:         - how quickly the cancer may grow.    - how likely it is that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.    - how well certain treatments might work.    - how likely the cancer is to recur (come back).        tests may include the following:         -   estrogen and progesterone receptor test : a test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. if there are more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. the test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone given after the baby is born may stop the cancer from growing.    -   human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (her2/neu) test : a laboratory test to measure how many her2/neu genes there are and how much her2/neu protein is made in a sample of tissue. if there are more her2/neu genes or higher levels of her2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called her2/neu positive. this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. the cancer may be treated with drugs that target the her2/neu protein, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, after the baby is born.    -  multigene tests: tests in which samples of tissue are studied to look at the activity of many genes at the same time. these tests may help predict whether cancer will spread to other parts of the body or recur (come back).               -  oncotype dx : this test helps predict whether stage i or stage ii breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and node-negative will spread to other parts of the body. if the risk of the cancer spreading is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.      -  mammaprint : this test helps predict whether stage i or stage ii breast cancer that is node-negative will spread to other parts of the body. if the risk of the cancer spreading is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk."
what are the genetic changes related to stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ?,"several genetic changes have been found to increase the risk of sjs/ten in response to triggering factors such as medications. most of these changes occur in genes that are involved in the normal function of the immune system.  the genetic variations most strongly associated with sjs/ten occur in the hla-b gene. this gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). the hla-b gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. certain variations in this gene occur much more often in people with sjs/ten than in people without the condition.  studies suggest that the hla-b gene variations associated with sjs/ten cause the immune system to react abnormally to certain medications. in a process that is not well understood, the drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic t cells and natural killer (nk) cells to release a substance called granulysin that destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes. the death of these cells causes the blistering and peeling that is characteristic of sjs/ten.  variations in several other hla and non-hla genes have also been studied as potential risk factors for sjs/ten. however, most people with genetic variations that increase the risk of sjs/ten never develop the disease, even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it. researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors, many of which are unknown, likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops sjs/ten.  the drugs most frequently associated with sjs/ten include several medications that are used to treat seizures (particularly carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin); allopurinol, which is used to treat kidney stones and a form of arthritis called gout; a class of antibiotic drugs called sulfonamides; nevirapine, which is used to treat hiv infection; and a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) called oxicams. other factors may also trigger sjs/ten. in particular, these skin reactions have occurred in people with an unusual form of pneumonia caused by infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae and in people with viral infections, including cytomegalovirus. researchers suspect that a combination of infections and drugs could contribute to the disease in some individuals. in many cases, no definitive trigger for an individual's sjs/ten is ever discovered."

is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus inherited ?,"how is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus inherited? when nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from mutations in the avpr2 gene, the condition has an x-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. the avpr2 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation usually has to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. however, some females who carry a single mutated copy of the avpr2 gene have features of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, including polyuria and polydipsia. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what are the treatments for parasites - lymphatic filariasis ?,"patients currently infected with the parasite
    
diethylcarbamazine (dec) is the drug of choice in the united states. the drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms. dec has been used world-wide for more than 50 years. because this infection is rare in the u.s., the drug is no longer approved by the food and drug administration (fda) and cannot be sold in the u.s. physicians can obtain the medication from cdc after confirmed positive lab results. cdc gives the physicians the choice between 1 or 12-day treatment of dec (6 mg/kg/day). one day treatment is generally as effective as the 12-day regimen. dec is generally well tolerated. side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. the most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints.
    
dec should not be administered to patients who may also have onchocerciasis as  dec can worsen onchocercal eye disease.  in patients with loiasis, dec can cause serious adverse reactions, including encephalopathy and death. the risk and severity of the adverse reactions are related to loa loa microfilarial density.
the drug ivermectin kills only the microfilariae, but not the adult worm; the adult worm is responsible for the pathology of lymphedema and hydrocele.
    
some studies have shown adult worm killing with treatment with doxycycline (200mg/day for 4–6 weeks).  
    patients with clinical symptoms
    
lymphedema and elephantiasis are not indications for dec treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite.
    
to prevent the lymphedema from getting worse, patients should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene, exercise and treatment of wounds.
    
patients with hydrocele may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with dec. the treatment for hydrocele is surgery.

what is (are) stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ?,"stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (sjs/ten) is a severe skin reaction most often triggered by particular medications. although stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were once thought to be separate conditions, they are now considered part of a continuum. stevens-johnson syndrome represents the less severe end of the disease spectrum, and toxic epidermal necrolysis represents the more severe end.  sjs/ten often begins with a fever and flu-like symptoms. within a few days, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming very painful raw areas called erosions that resemble a severe hot-water burn. the skin erosions usually start on the face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. in most affected individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and breathing. the painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and genitals. sjs/ten often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea).  severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes sjs/ten a life-threatening disease. because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop. serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis), shock, multiple organ failure, and death. about 10 percent of people with stevens-johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis.  among people who survive, long-term effects of sjs/ten can include changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), dryness of the skin and mucous membranes (xerosis), excess sweating (hyperhidrosis), hair loss (alopecia), and abnormal growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails. other long-term problems can include impaired taste, difficulty urinating, and genital abnormalities. a small percentage of affected individuals develop chronic dryness or inflammation of the eyes, which can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) and vision impairment."

how to diagnose cushing's syndrome ?,"diagnosis is based on a review of a person's medical history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. x rays of the adrenal or pituitary glands can be useful in locating tumors.
                
tests to diagnose cushing's syndrome
                
no single lab test is perfect and usually several are needed. the three most common tests used to diagnose cushing's syndrome are the 24-hour urinary free cortisol test, measurement of midnight plasma cortisol or late-night salivary cortisol, and the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. another test, the dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone test, may be needed to distinguish cushing's syndrome from other causes of excess cortisol.
                
- 24-hour urinary free cortisol level. in this test, a person's urine is collected several times over a 24-hour period and tested for cortisol. levels higher than 50 to 100 micrograms a day for an adult suggest cushing's syndrome. the normal upper limit varies in different laboratories, depending on which measurement technique is used.  - midnight plasma cortisol and late-night salivary cortisol measurements. the midnight plasma cortisol test measures cortisol concentrations in the blood. cortisol production is normally suppressed at night, but in cushing's syndrome, this suppression doesn't occur. if the cortisol level is more than 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/l), cushing's syndrome is suspected. the test generally requires a 48-hour hospital stay to avoid falsely elevated cortisol levels due to stress.   however, a late-night or bedtime saliva sample can be obtained at home, then tested to determine the cortisol level. diagnostic ranges vary, depending on the measurement technique used.  - low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (lddst). in the lddst, a person is given a low dose of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, by mouth every 6 hours for 2 days. urine is collected before dexamethasone is administered and several times on each day of the test. a modified lddst uses a onetime overnight dose.  cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the pituitary to release less acth, so the normal response after taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine cortisol levels. if cortisol levels do not drop, cushing's syndrome is suspected. the lddst may not show a drop in cortisol levels in people with depression, alcoholism, high estrogen levels, acute illness, or stress, falsely indicating cushing's syndrome. on the other hand, drugs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital may cause cortisol levels to drop, falsely indicating that cushings is not present in people who actually have the syndrome. for this reason, physicians usually advise their patients to stop taking these drugs at least 1 week before the test.  - dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) test. some people have high cortisol levels but do not develop the progressive effects of cushing's syndrome, such as muscle weakness, fractures, and thinning of the skin. these people may have pseudo-cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety disorders, drink excess alcohol, have poorly controlled diabetes, or are severely obese. pseudo-cushings does not have the same long-term effects on health as cushing's syndrome and does not require treatment directed at the endocrine glands.  the dexamethasone-crh test rapidly distinguishes pseudo-cushing's from mild cases of cushing's. this test combines the lddst and a crh stimulation test. in the crh stimulation test, an injection of crh causes the pituitary to secrete acth. pretreatment with dexamethasone prevents crh from causing an increase in cortisol in people with pseudo-cushing's. elevations of cortisol during this test suggest cushing's syndrome.
                
tests to find the cause of cushing's syndrome
                
once cushing's syndrome has been diagnosed, other tests are used to find the exact location of the abnormality that leads to excess cortisol production. the choice of test depends, in part, on the preference of the endocrinologist or the center where the test is performed.
                
- crh stimulation test. the crh test, without pretreatment with dexamethasone, helps separate people with pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic acth syndrome or adrenal tumors. as a result of the crh injection, people with pituitary adenomas usually experience a rise in blood levels of acth and cortisol because crh acts directly on the pituitary. this response is rarely seen in people with ectopic acth syndrome and practically never in those with adrenal tumors.  - high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (hddst). the hddst is the same as the lddst, except it uses higher doses of dexamethasone. this test helps separate people with excess production of acth due to pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic acth-producing tumors. high doses of dexamethasone usually suppress cortisol levels in people with pituitary adenomas but not in those with ectopic acth-producing tumors.  - radiologic imaging: direct visualization of the endocrine glands. imaging tests reveal the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and help determine if a tumor is present. the most common imaging tests are the computerized tomography (ct) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (mri). a ct scan produces a series of x-ray pictures giving a cross-sectional image of a body part. mri also produces images of internal organs but without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  imaging procedures are used to find a tumor after a diagnosis has been made. imaging is not used to make the diagnosis of cushing's syndrome because benign tumors are commonly found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. these tumors, sometimes called incidentalomas, do not produce hormones in quantities that are harmful. they are not removed unless blood tests show they are a cause of symptoms or they are unusually large. conversely, pituitary tumors may not be detectable by imaging in almost half of people who ultimately need pituitary surgery for cushing's syndrome.  - petrosal sinus sampling. this test is not always required, but in many cases, it is the best way to distinguish pituitary from ectopic causes of cushing's syndrome. samples of blood are drawn from the petrosal sinuses-veins that drain the pituitary-by inserting tiny tubes through a vein in the upper thigh or groin region. a local anesthetic and mild sedation are given, and x rays are taken to confirm the correct position of the tubes. often crh, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release acth, is given during this test to improve diagnostic accuracy.  levels of acth in the petrosal sinuses are measured and compared with acth levels in a forearm vein. higher levels of acth in the sinuses than in the forearm vein indicate a pituitary adenoma. similar levels of acth in the petrosal sinuses and the forearm suggest ectopic acth syndrome."

your weight is the result of many factors. these factors include environment, family history and genetics, metabolism (the way your body changes food and oxygen into energy), behavior or habits, and more.
                
you can't change some factors, such as family history. however, you can change other factors, such as your lifestyle habits.
                
for example, follow a healthy eating plan and keep your calorie needs in mind. be physically active and try to limit the amount of time that you're inactive.
                
weight-loss medicines and surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren't enough.

                    the results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to find out if cancer cells have spread.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. for bile duct cancer, the information gathered from tests and procedures is used to plan treatment, including whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if bile duct cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually bile duct cancer cells. the disease is metastatic bile duct cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    stages are used to describe the different types of bile duct cancer.
                    intrahepatic bile duct cancer            -  stage 0: abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the intrahepatic bile duct. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.     -  stage i: there is one tumor that has spread into the intrahepatic bile duct and it has not spread into any blood vessels.     -  stage ii: there is one tumor that has spread through the wall of the bile duct and into a blood vessel, or there are multiple tumors that may have spread into a blood vessel.      -  stage iii: the tumor has spread through the tissue that lines the abdominal wall or has spread to organs or tissues near the liver such as the duodenum, colon, and stomach.      -  stage iv: stage iv is divided into stage iva and stage ivb.                  - stage iva: the cancer has spread along the outside of the intrahepatic bile ducts or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.       - stage ivb: the cancer has spread to organs in other parts of the body.                         perihilar bile duct cancer            -  stage 0: abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the perihilar bile duct. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.     -  stage i: cancer has formed in the innermost layer of the wall of the perihilar bile duct and has spread into the muscle layer or fibrous tissue layer of the wall.     -  stage ii: cancer has spread through the wall of the perihilar bile duct to nearby fatty tissue or to the liver.     -  stage iii: stage iii is divided into stage iiia and stage iiib.                  - stage iiia: cancer has spread to branches on one side of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein.        - stage iiib: cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. cancer may have spread into the wall of the perihilar bile duct or through the wall to nearby fatty tissue, the liver, or to branches on one side of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein.                -  stage iv: stage iv is divided into stage iva and stage ivb.                   - stage iva: cancer has spread to one or more of the following:                           - the main part of the portal vein and/or common hepatic artery;          - the branches of the portal vein and/or common hepatic artery on both sides;           - the right hepatic duct and the left branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein;          - the left hepatic duct and the right branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein.                  cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.       - stage ivb: cancer has spread to lymph nodes in more distant parts of the abdomen, or to organs in other parts of the body.                         distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer            -  stage 0: abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the distal extrahepatic bile duct. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.     -  stage i: stage i is divided into stage ia and stage ib.                  - stage ia: cancer has formed and is found in the distal extrahepatic bile duct wall only.       - stage ib: cancer has formed and has spread through the wall of the distal extrahepatic bile duct but has not spread to nearby organs.                -  stage ii: stage ii is divided into stage iia and stage iib.                  - stage iia: cancer has spread from the distal extrahepatic bile duct to the gallbladder, pancreas, duodenum, or other nearby organs.       - stage iib: cancer has spread from the distal extrahepatic bile duct to nearby lymph nodes. cancer may have spread through the wall of the duct or to nearby organs.                -  stage iii: cancer has spread to the large vessels that carry blood to the organs in the abdomen. cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  stage iv:  cancer has spread to organs in distant parts of the body.
                
                
                    the following groups are used to plan treatment:
                    resectable (localized) bile duct cancer    the cancer is in an area, such as the lower part of the common bile duct or perihilar area, where it can be removed completely by surgery.       unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer     unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery. most patients with bile duct cancer cannot have their cancer completely removed by surgery.     metastasis is the spread of cancer from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body. metastatic bile duct cancer may have spread to the liver, other parts of the abdominal cavity, or to distant parts of the body.      recurrent bile duct cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. the cancer may come back in the bile ducts, liver, or gallbladder. less often, it may come back in distant parts of the body."
how many people are affected by early-onset primary dystonia ?,"early-onset primary dystonia is among the most common forms of childhood dystonia. this disorder occurs most frequently in people of ashkenazi (central and eastern european) jewish heritage, affecting 1 in 3,000 to 9,000 people in this population. the condition is less common among people with other backgrounds; it is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 non-jewish people worldwide."
what are the symptoms of pcdh19-related female-limited epilepsy ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of pcdh19-related female-limited epilepsy? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for pcdh19-related female-limited epilepsy. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) intellectual disability 30% absence seizures - aggressive behavior - atonic seizures - focal seizures - generalized myoclonic seizures - generalized tonic-clonic seizures - infantile onset - psychosis - status epilepticus - x-linked inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to stargardt macular degeneration ?,"in most cases, stargardt macular degeneration is caused by mutations in the abca4 gene. less often, mutations in the elovl4 gene cause this condition. the abca4 and elovl4 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in light-sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina.  the abca4 protein transports potentially toxic substances out of photoreceptor cells. these substances form after phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. mutations in the abca4 gene prevent the abca4 protein from removing toxic byproducts from photoreceptor cells. these toxic substances build up and form lipofuscin in the photoreceptor cells and the surrounding cells of the retina, eventually causing cell death. loss of cells in the retina causes the progressive vision loss characteristic of stargardt macular degeneration.  the elovl4 protein plays a role in making a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. the elovl4 protein is primarily active (expressed) in the retina, but is also expressed in the brain and skin. the function of very long-chain fatty acids within the retina is unknown. mutations in the elovl4 gene lead to the formation of elovl4 protein clumps (aggregates) that build up and may interfere with retinal cell functions, ultimately leading to cell death."
