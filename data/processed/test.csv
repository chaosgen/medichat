what are the symptoms of kenny-caffey syndrome type 1 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of kenny-caffey syndrome type 1? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for kenny-caffey syndrome type 1. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) anemia - autosomal recessive inheritance - birth length less than 3rd percentile - calvarial osteosclerosis - carious teeth - congenital hypoparathyroidism - decreased skull ossification - delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle - delayed skeletal maturation - hypertelorism - hypocalcemia - hypomagnesemia - intrauterine growth retardation - long clavicles - proportionate short stature - recurrent bacterial infections - seizures - short foot - short palm - slender long bone - small hand - tetany - thin clavicles - thin ribs - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
is hereditary multiple osteochondromas inherited ?,"how is hereditary multiple osteochondromas inherited? hmo is caused by mutations in the ext1 and ext2 genes. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause this condition. in most cases, an affected individual inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family. most affected individuals (96%) that have inherited a gene mutation from their parent show signs and symptoms of this condition. however, the family history may appear negative because of the failure to recognize the disorder in family members and/or reduced penetrance. reports have suggested that some females may not show clinical features of hmo but still have the gene mutation that causes this condition."
what are the genetic changes related to 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome ?,"8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome is caused by rearrangements of genetic material (translocations) between two chromosomes. all of the translocations that cause this condition involve the fgfr1 gene, which is found on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8 at a position described as p11. the translocations lead to fusion of part of the fgfr1 gene with part of another gene; the most common partner gene is zmym2 on chromosome 13. these genetic changes are found only in cancer cells.  the protein normally produced from the fgfr1 gene can trigger a cascade of chemical reactions that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as growing and dividing. this signaling is turned on when the fgfr1 protein interacts with growth factors. in contrast, when the fgfr1 gene is fused with another gene, fgfr1 signaling is turned on without the need for stimulation by growth factors. the uncontrolled signaling promotes continuous cell growth and division, leading to cancer.  researchers believe the mutations that cause this condition occur in a very early blood cell called a stem cell that has the ability to mature into either a myeloid cell or a lymphoid cell. for this reason, this condition is sometimes referred to as stem cell leukemia/lymphoma."
what are the genetic changes related to crigler-najjar syndrome ?,"mutations in the ugt1a1 gene cause crigler-najjar syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (bilirubin-ugt) enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body.  the bilirubin-ugt enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. during this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body.  mutations in the ugt1a1 gene that cause crigler-najjar syndrome result in reduced or absent function of the bilirubin-ugt enzyme. people with cn1 have no enzyme function, while people with cn2 have less than 20 percent of normal function. the loss of bilirubin-ugt function decreases glucuronidation of unconjugated bilirubin. this toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice."
is gordon syndrome inherited ?,"how is gordon syndrome inherited? while some reports suggest gordon syndrome may be inherited in an x-linked dominant manner, most agree that it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced expressivity and incomplete penetrance in females. in autosomal dominant inheritance, having only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. when an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. if a condition shows variable or reduced expressivity, it means that there can be a range in the nature and severity of signs and symptoms among affected individuals. incomplete penetrance means that a portion of the individuals who carry the mutated copy of the disease-causing gene will not have any features of the condition."
"what is (are) 48,xxyy syndrome ?","48,xxyy syndrome is a chromosomal condition that causes medical and behavioral problems in males.  48,xxyy disrupts male sexual development. adolescent and adult males with this condition typically have small testes that do not produce enough testosterone, which is the hormone that directs male sexual development. a shortage of testosterone during puberty can lead to reduced facial and body hair, poor muscle development, low energy levels, and an increased risk for breast enlargement (gynecomastia). because their testes do not function normally, males with 48, xxyy syndrome have an inability to father children (infertility).  48,xxyy syndrome can affect other parts of the body as well. males with 48,xxyy syndrome are often taller than other males their age. they tend to develop a tremor that typically starts in adolescence and worsens with age. dental problems are frequently seen with this condition; they include delayed appearance of the primary (baby) or secondary (adult) teeth, thin tooth enamel, crowded and/or misaligned teeth, and multiple cavities. as affected males get older, they may develop a narrowing of the blood vessels in the legs, called peripheral vascular disease. peripheral vascular disease can cause skin ulcers to form. affected males are also at risk for developing a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) that occurs in the deep veins of the legs. additionally, males with 48,xxyy syndrome may have flat feet (pes planus), elbow abnormalities, allergies, asthma, type 2 diabetes, seizures, and congenital heart defects.  most males with 48,xxyy syndrome have some degree of difficulty with speech and language development. learning disabilities, especially reading problems, are very common in males with this disorder. affected males seem to perform better at tasks focused on math, visual-spatial skills such as puzzles, and memorization of locations or directions. some boys with 48,xxyy syndrome have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking that can lead to poor coordination. affected males have higher than average rates of behavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd); mood disorders, including anxiety and bipolar disorder; and/or autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction."
how to prevent marburg hemorrhagic fever (marburg hf) ?,"preventive measures against marburg virus infection are not well defined, as transmission from wildlife to humans remains an area of ongoing research. however, avoiding fruit bats, and sick non-human primates in central africa, is one way to protect against infection. 
 
measures for prevention of secondary, or person-to-person, transmission are similar to those used for other hemorrhagic fevers. if a patient is either suspected or confirmed to have marburg hemorrhagic fever, barrier nursing techniques should be used to prevent direct physical contact with the patient. these precautions include wearing of protective gowns, gloves, and masks; placing the infected individual in strict isolation; and sterilization or proper disposal of needles, equipment, and patient excretions. 
 
in conjunction with the world health organization, cdc has developed practical, hospital-based guidelines, titled: infection control for viral haemorrhagic fevers in the african health care setting. the manual can help health-care facilities recognize cases and prevent further hospital-based disease transmission using locally available materials and few financial resources. 
 
marburg hemorrhagic fever is a very rare human disease. however, when it occurs, it has the potential to spread to other people, especially health care staff and family members who care for the patient. therefore, increasing awareness in communities and among health-care providers of the clinical symptoms of patients with marburg hemorrhagic fever is critical. better awareness can lead to earlier and stronger precautions against the spread of marburg virus in both family members and health-care providers. improving the use of diagnostic tools is another priority. with modern means of transportation that give access even to remote areas, it is possible to obtain rapid testing of samples in disease control centers equipped with biosafety level 4 laboratories in order to confirm or rule out marburg virus infection."
do you have information about alcohol,"summary : if you are like many americans, you drink alcohol at least occasionally. for many people, moderate drinking is probably safe. it may even have health benefits, including reducing your risk of certain heart problems. for most women and for most people over 65, moderate drinking is no more than three drinks a day or seven drinks per week. for men under 65, it is no more than four drinks a day or 14 drinks per week.    some people should not drink at all, including alcoholics, children, pregnant women, people taking certain medicines, and people with certain medical conditions. if you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, speak with your health care provider.    anything more than moderate drinking can be risky. heavy drinking can lead to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, as well as injuries, liver disease, heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. it can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends.    nih: national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism"
what causes irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"the causes of ibs are not well understood. researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to ibs. the possible causes of ibs in children include the following:
                
- brain-gut signal problems. signals between the brain and nerves of the small and large intestines, also called the gut, control how the intestines work. problems with brain-gut signals may cause ibs symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits and pain or discomfort.  - gi motor problems. normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a child who has ibs. slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. spasms, or sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go, can cause abdominal pain. some children with ibs also experience hyperreactivity, which is an excessive increase in contractions of the bowel in response to stress or eating.  - hypersensitivity. children with ibs have greater sensitivity to abdominal pain than children without ibs. affected children have been found to have different rectal tone and rectal motor response after eating a meal.  - mental health problems. ibs has been linked to mental health, or psychological, problems such as anxiety and depression in children.  - bacterial gastroenteritis. some children who have bacterial gastroenteritisan infection or irritation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteriadevelop ibs. research has shown a connection between gastroenteritis and ibs in adults but not in children. but researchers believe postinfectious ibs does occur in children. researchers do not know why gastroenteritis leads to ibs in some people and not others.  - small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo). normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. sibo is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. these bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. some researchers believe that sibo may lead to ibs, and some studies have shown antibiotics to be effective in treating ibs. however, the studies were weak and more research is needed to show a link between sibo and ibs.  - genetics. whether ibs has a genetic cause, meaning it runs in families, is unclear. studies have shown that ibs is more common in people with family members who have a history of gi problems. however, the cause could be environmental or the result of heightened awareness of gi symptoms."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for menkes disease ?,"recent research sponsored by the ninds developed a blood test that could be given to newborns at risk for menkes disease based on a positive family history for the disorder or other indications. the test measures 4 different chemicals in the blood and, depending upon their levels, can accurately diagnose the presence of menkes disease before symptoms appear. study results showed higher survival rates for children given the earliest copper injection treatment and improved, if not normal, 2. additional research is being performed by the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development, in collaboration with the ninds, that applies gene therapy approaches to menkes disease.3

how to prevent viral gastroenteritis ?,"people can reduce their chances of getting or spreading viral gastroenteritis if they
                
- wash their hands thoroughly with soap and warm water for 20 seconds after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before eating or handling food  - disinfect contaminated surfaces such as countertops and baby changing tables with a mixture of 2 cups of household bleach and 1 gallon of water  - avoid foods and drinks that might be contaminated
                
the u.s. food and drug administration has approved two vaccines to protect children from rotavirus infections: rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent (rotateq); and rotavirus vaccine, live, oral (rotarix). rotateq is given to infants in three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. rotarix is given in two doses. the first dose is given when the infant is 6 weeks old, and the second is given at least 4 weeks later but before the infant is 24 weeks old.
                
parents of infants should discuss rotavirus vaccination with a health care provider. for more information, parents can visit the centers for disease control and prevention rotavirus vaccination webpage at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus.
                
in the past, rotavirus infections were most common from november to april in the united states. however, recently widespread vaccination slowed the transmission of the virus, delaying rotavirus activity until late february. overall rates of infection have also been lower than in previous years."
what are the treatments for urinary retention ?,"a health care provider treats urinary retention with
                
- bladder drainage  - urethral dilation  - urethral stents  - prostate medications  - surgery
                
the type and length of treatment depend on the type and cause of urinary retention.
                
bladder drainage
                
bladder drainage involves catheterization to drain urine. treatment of acute urinary retention begins with catheterization to relieve the immediate distress of a full bladder and prevent bladder damage. a health care provider performs catheterization during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. the patient often receives local anesthesia. the health care provider can pass a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. in cases of a blocked urethra, he or she can pass a catheter directly through the lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone, directly into the bladder. in these cases, the health care provider will use anesthesia.
                
for chronic urinary retention, the patient may require intermittentoccasional, or not continuousor long-term catheterization if other treatments do not work. patients who need to continue intermittent catheterization will receive instruction regarding how to selfcatheterize to drain urine as necessary.
                
urethral dilation
                
urethral dilation treats urethral stricture by inserting increasingly wider tubes into the urethra to widen the stricture. an alternative dilation method involves inflating a small balloon at the end of a catheter inside the urethra. a health care provider performs a urethral dilation during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. the patient will receive local anesthesia. in some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.
                
urethral stents
                
another treatment for urethral stricture involves inserting an artificial tube, called a stent, into the urethra to the area of the stricture. once in place, the stent expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue, widening the urethra. stents may be temporary or permanent. a health care provider performs stent placement during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. the patient will receive local anesthesia. in some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.
                
prostate medications
                
medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or relieve urinary retention symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia include
                
- dutasteride (avodart)  - finasteride (proscar)
                
the following medications relax the muscles of the bladder outlet and prostate to help relieve blockage:
                
- alfuzosin (uroxatral)  - doxazosin (cardura)  - silodosin (rapaflo)  - tadalafil (cialis)  - tamsulosin (flomax)  - terazosin (hytrin)
                
surgery
                
prostate surgery. to treat urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tractmay surgically destroy or remove enlarged prostate tissue by using the transurethral method. for transurethral surgery, the urologist inserts a catheter or surgical instruments through the urethra to reach the prostate. removal of the enlarged tissue usually relieves the blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. a urologist performs some procedures on an outpatient basis. some men may require a hospital stay. in some cases, the urologist will remove the entire prostate using open surgery. men will receive general anesthesia and have a longer hospital stay than for other surgical procedures. men will also have a longer rehabilitation period for open surgery.
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic, prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
internal urethrotomy. a urologist can repair a urethral stricture by performing an internal urethrotomy. for this procedure, the urologist inserts a special catheter into the urethra until it reaches the stricture. the urologist then uses a knife or laser to make an incision that opens the stricture. the urologist performs an internal urethrotomy in an outpatient center or a hospital. the patient will receive general anesthesia.
                
cystocele or rectocele repair. women may need surgery to lift a fallen bladder or rectum into its normal position. the most common procedure for cystocele and rectocele repair involves a urologist, who also specializes in the female reproductive system, making an incision in the wall of the vagina. through the incision, the urologist looks for a defect or hole in the tissue that normally separates the vagina from the other pelvic organs. the urologist places stitches in the tissue to close up the defect and then closes the incision in the vaginal wall with more stitches, removing any extra tissue. these stitches tighten the layers of tissue that separate the organs, creating more support for the pelvic organs. a urologist or gynecologista doctor who specializes in the female reproductive systemperforms the surgery to repair a cystocele or rectocele in a hospital. women will receive anesthesia.
                
tumor and cancer surgery. removal of tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra may reduce urethral obstruction and urinary retention."
what is (are) nutrition for early chronic kidney disease in adults ?,"mnt is the use of nutrition counseling by a registered dietitian to help promote a medical or health goal. a doctor may refer a patient to a registered dietitian to help with the patients food plan. many insurance policies cover mnt when recommended by a doctor. anyone who qualifies for medicare can receive a benefit for mnt from a registered dietitian or nutrition professional when a doctor provides a referral indicating the person has diabetes or kidney disease.
                
one way to locate a qualified dietitian is to contact the american dietetic association at www.eatright.organd click on find a registered dietitian. users can enter their address or zip code for a list of dietitians in their area. a person looking for dietary advice to prevent kidney damage should click on renal (kidney) nutrition in the specialty field. dietitians who specialize in helping people with ckd are called renal dietitians."
what is (are) fragile x syndrome ?,"fragile x syndrome is a genetic condition involving changes in part of the x chromosome. this condition causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. it is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability in males and a significant cause of intellectual disability in females. other signs and symptoms may include symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, seizures, and characteristic physical features. fragile x syndrome is caused by a change (mutation) in the fmr1 gene and is inherited in an x-linked dominant manner."
what is (are) congenital stromal corneal dystrophy ?,"congenital stromal corneal dystrophy is an inherited eye disorder. this condition primarily affects the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the eye. in people with this condition, the cornea appears cloudy and may have an irregular surface. these corneal changes lead to visual impairment, including blurring, glare, and a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity). visual impairment is often associated with additional eye abnormalities, including ""lazy eye"" (amblyopia), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)."
what is (are) fungal infections ?,"if you have ever had athlete's foot or a yeast infection, you can blame a fungus. a fungus is a primitive organism. mushrooms, mold and mildew are examples. fungi live in air, in soil, on plants and in water. some live in the human body. only about half of all types of fungi are harmful.    some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. you can inhale the spores or they can land on you. as a result, fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. you are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics.    fungi can be difficult to kill. for skin and nail infections, you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections.    nih: national institute of allergy and infectious diseases"
how to diagnose zollinger-ellison syndrome ?,"a health care provider diagnoses zollinger-ellison syndrome based on the following:
                
- medical history   - physical exam  - signs and symptoms  - blood tests  - upper gastrointestinal (gi) endoscopy  - imaging tests to look for gastrinomas  - measurement of stomach acid
                
medical history
                
taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose zollinger-ellison syndrome. the health care provider may ask about family cases of men1 in particular.
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam may help diagnose zollinger-ellison syndrome. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body
                
signs and symptoms
                
a health care provider may suspect zollinger-ellison syndrome if
                
- diarrhea accompanies peptic ulcer symptoms or if peptic ulcer treatment fails.  - a person has peptic ulcers without the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin and ibuprofen or a bacterial helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection. nsaid use and h. pylori infection may cause peptic ulcers.  - a person has severe ulcers that bleed or cause holes in the duodenum or stomach.  - a health care provider diagnoses a person or the persons family member with men1 or a person has symptoms of men1.
                
blood tests
                
the health care provider may use blood tests to check for an elevated gastrin level. a technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. a health care provider will ask the person to fast for several hours prior to the test and may ask the person to stop acid-reducing medications for a period of time before the test. a gastrin level that is 10 times higher than normal suggests zollinger-ellison syndrome.2
                
a health care provider may also check for an elevated gastrin level after an infusion of secretin. secretin is a hormone that causes gastrinomas to release more gastrin. a technician or nurse places an intravenous (iv) needle in a vein in the arm to give an infusion of secretin. a health care provider may suspect zollinger-ellison syndrome if blood drawn after the infusion shows an elevated gastrin level.
                
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
                
the health care provider uses an upper gi endoscopy to check the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for ulcers and esophagitisa general term used to describe irritation and swelling of the esophagus. this procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. the gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. a person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. a technician or nurse inserts an iv needle in a vein in the arm if anesthesia is given.
                
imaging tests
                
to help find gastrinomas, a health care provider may order one or more of the following imaging tests:
                
- computerized tomography (ct) scan. a ct scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. a ct scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes x rays. a computer puts the different views together to create a model of the pancreas, stomach, and duodenum. the x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. the person does not need anesthesia. ct scans can show tumors and ulcers.  - magnetic resonance imaging (mri). mri is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. the person does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. an mri may include the injection of contrast medium. with most mri machines, the person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. some machines allow the person to lie in a more open space. during an mri, the person, although usually awake, remains perfectly still while the technician takes the images, which usually takes only a few minutes. the technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the upper gi tract. during sequencing, the person will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises.  - endoscopic ultrasound. this procedure involves using a special endoscope called an endoechoscope to perform ultrasound of the pancreas. the endoechoscope has a built-in miniature ultrasound probe that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. a gastroenterologist performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. the gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoechoscope down the esophagus, through the stomach and duodenum, until it is near the pancreas. a person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. a sedative helps the person stay relaxed and comfortable. the images can show gastrinomas in the pancreas.  - angiogram. an angiogram is a special kind of x ray in which an interventional radiologista specially trained radiologistthreads a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the large arteries, often from the groin, to the artery of interest. the radiologist injects contrast medium through the catheter so the images show up more clearly on the x ray. the interventional radiologist performs the procedure and interprets the images in a hospital or an outpatient center. a person does not need anesthesia, though a light sedative may help reduce a persons anxiety during the procedure. this test can show gastrinomas in the pancreas.  - somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. an x-ray technician performs this test, also called octreoscan, at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. a person does not need anesthesia. a radioactive compound called a radiotracer, when injected into the bloodstream, selectively labels tumor cells. the labeled cells light up when scanned with a device called a gamma camera. the test can show gastrinomas in the duodenum, pancreas, and other parts of the body.
                
small gastrinomas may be hard to see; therefore, health care providers may order several types of imaging tests to find gastrinomas.
                
stomach-acid measurement
                
using a sample of stomach juices for analysis, a health care provider may measure the amount of stomach acid a person produces. during the exam, a health care provider puts in a nasogastric tubea tiny tube inserted through the nose and throat that reaches into the stomach. a person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. once the tube is placed, a health care provider takes samples of the stomach acid. high acid levels in the stomach indicate zollinger-ellison syndrome."
is congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens inherited ?,"how is congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) inherited? when this condition is caused by mutations in the cftr gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. this pattern of inheritance means that both copies of the gene in each cell have a mutation. parents of a person with cbavd each carry one cftr mutation, but are usually unaffected (carriers). men with cbavd who choose to father children through assisted reproduction have an increased risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. if congenital absence of the vas deferens is not caused by mutations in cftr, the risk of having children with cystic fibrosis is not increased. the risk to siblings of a person with cbavd depends on the affected person's cftr gene mutation(s) and cannot readily be predicted without this information. genetic testing is most informative when the cbavd-causing mutations have been identified in the affected individual. men with cbavd sometimes have only one identifiable cftr mutation, complicating the testing and interpretation of results in their family members. we recommend speaking with a genetics professional about risk to other family members as well as any appropriate genetic testing."
what is (are) gastroenteritis ?,"have you ever had the ""stomach flu?"" what you probably had was gastroenteritis - not a type of flu at all. gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria or parasites. viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the u.s. the cause is often a norovirus infection. it spreads through contaminated food or water, and contact with an infected person. the best prevention is frequent hand washing.     symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, fever and chills. most people recover with no treatment.    the most common problem with gastroenteritis is dehydration. this happens if you do not drink enough fluids to replace what you lose through vomiting and diarrhea. dehydration is most common in babies, young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems.     nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
is progressive supranuclear palsy inherited ?,"most cases of progressive supranuclear palsy are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. however, some people with this disorder have had family members with related conditions, such as parkinsonism and a loss of intellectual functions (dementia).  when progressive supranuclear palsy runs in families, it can have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."

what causes what i need to know about diverticular disease ?,"doctors are not sure what causes diverticular disease. many think a diet low in fiber is the main cause. fiber is a part of food that your body cannot digest. it is found in many fruits and vegetables. fiber stays in the colon and absorbs water, which makes bowel movements easier to pass. diets low in fiber may cause constipation, which occurs when stools are hard and difficult to pass. constipation causes your muscles to strain when you pass stool. straining may cause diverticula to form in the colon. if stool or bacteria get caught in the pouches, diverticulitis can occur."

                    childhood extracranial germ cell tumors form from germ cells in parts of the body other than the brain.
                    a germ cell is a type of cell that forms as a fetus (unborn baby) develops. these cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries. sometimes while the fetus is forming, germ cells travel to parts of the body where they should not be and grow into a germ cell tumor. the tumor may form before or after birth.   this summary is about germ cell tumors that form in parts of the body that are extracranial (outside the brain). extracranial germ cell tumors usually form in the following areas of the body:          - testicles.    - ovaries.    -  sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine).    - retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).    -  mediastinum (area between the lungs).               extracranial germ cell tumors are most common in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age.   see the pdq summary on childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors treatment for information on intracranial (inside the brain) germ cell tumors.
                
                
                    childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign or malignant.
                    extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer).
                
                
                    there are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped into mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and malignant germ cell tumors:      mature teratomas     mature teratomas are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. mature teratomas are benign tumors and not likely to become cancer. they usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or in the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. the cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope. some mature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       immature teratomas     immature teratomas also usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. immature teratomas have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. immature teratomas may be cancer. they often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. some immature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       malignant germ cell tumors     malignant germ cell tumors are cancer. there are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors:            - germinomas: tumors that make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg). there are three types of germinomas.                  -  dysgerminomas form in the ovary in girls.       -  seminomas form in the testicle in boys.       - germinomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle.                - nongerminomas: there are four types of nongerminomas.                  - yolk sac tumors make a hormone called alpha-fetoprotein (afp). they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  choriocarcinomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg). they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  embryonal carcinomas may make a hormone called -hcg and/or a hormone called afp. they can form in the testicle or other parts of the body, but not in the ovary.       - mixed germ cell tumors are made up of both malignant germ cell tumor and teratoma. they can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.
                
                
                    childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped as gonadal or extragonadal.
                    malignant extracranial germ cell tumors are gonadal or extragonadal.     gonadal germ cell tumors    gonadal germ cell tumors form in the testicles in boys or ovaries in girls.          testicular germ cell tumors        testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two main types, seminoma and nonseminoma.               - seminomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg).      - nonseminomas are usually large and cause signs or symptoms. they tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas.              testicular germ cell tumors usually occur before the age of 4 years or in adolescents and young adults. testicular germ cell tumors in adolescents and young adults are different from those that form in early childhood.     boys older than 14 years with testicular germ cell tumors are treated in pediatric cancer centers, but the treatment is much like the treatment used in adults. (see the pdq summary on testicular cancer treatment for more information.)             ovarian germ cell tumors        ovarian germ cell tumors are more common in adolescent girls and young women. most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign teratomas. sometimes immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors (cancer) occur. (see the pdq summary on ovarian germ cell tumors treatment for more information.)          extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors    extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form in areas other than the brain, testicles, or ovaries.    most extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form along the midline of the body. this includes the following:             - sacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower spine that forms part of the pelvis).     -  coccyx (the small bone at the bottom of the spine, also called the tailbone).     -  mediastinum (the area between the lungs).     -  back of the abdomen.     -  neck.           in younger children, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. most of these tumors are teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx.    in older children, adolescents, and young adults, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum."
what is (are) age-related macular degeneration ?,"the areds formulation is a combination of antioxidants and zinc that is named for a study conducted by the national eye institute called the age-related eye disease study, or areds. this study found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduced the risk of advanced amd and its associated vision loss. slowing amd's progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage will save many people's vision."
is friedreich ataxia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?,lbsl is a rare condition. its exact prevalence is not known.
how many people are affected by aicardi-goutieres syndrome ?,aicardi-goutieres syndrome is a rare disorder. its exact prevalence is unknown.
how many people are affected by pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy occurs in 1 in 100,000 to 700,000 individuals. at least 100 cases have been reported worldwide."
is fryns syndrome inherited ?,"how is fryns syndrome inherited? although the exact cause of fryns syndrome is not currently known (and no disease-causing gene has yet been identified), it is thought to be genetic because it tends to ""run in families"" and has features common to other genetic disorders. it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell of the body (one copy inherited from each parent) have mutations. the parents of an affected individual are referred to as carriers, who typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."
what are the genetic changes related to ewing sarcoma ?,"the most common mutation that causes ewing sarcoma involves two genes, the ewsr1 gene on chromosome 22 and the fli1 gene on chromosome 11. a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the ewsr1 gene with part of the fli1 gene, creating the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene. this mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. this type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.  the protein produced from the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene, called ews/fli, has functions of the protein products of both genes. the fli protein, produced from the fli1 gene, attaches (binds) to dna and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. the fli protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. the ews protein, produced from the ewsr1 gene, also regulates transcription. the ews/fli protein has the dna-binding function of the fli protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the ews protein. it is thought that the ews/fli protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. this dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development.  the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of ewing sarcomas. translocations that fuse the ewsr1 gene with other genes that are related to the fli1 gene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon. the fusion proteins produced from the less common gene translocations have the same function as the ews/fli protein."
what is the outlook for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ?,certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for cmml depend on the following:         - the number of white blood cells or platelets in the blood or bone marrow.    - whether the patient is anemic.    - the amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow.    - the amount of hemoglobin in red blood cells.    - whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.

what is (are) oral-facial-digital syndrome ?,"oral-facial-digital syndrome is actually a group of related conditions that affect the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes).  researchers have identified at least 13 potential forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome. the different types are classified by their patterns of signs and symptoms. however, the features of the various types overlap significantly, and some types are not well defined. the classification system for oral-facial-digital syndrome continues to evolve as researchers find more affected individuals and learn more about this disorder.  the signs and symptoms of oral-facial-digital syndrome vary widely. however, most forms of this disorder involve problems with development of the oral cavity, facial features, and digits. most forms are also associated with brain abnormalities and some degree of intellectual disability.  abnormalities of the oral cavity that occur in many types of oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split (cleft) in the tongue, a tongue with an unusual lobed shape, and the growth of noncancerous tumors or nodules on the tongue. affected individuals may also have extra, missing, or defective teeth. another common feature is an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). some people with oral-facial-digital syndrome have bands of extra tissue (called hyperplastic frenula) that abnormally attach the lip to the gums.  distinctive facial features often associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split in the lip (a cleft lip); a wide nose with a broad, flat nasal bridge; and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism).  abnormalities of the digits can affect both the fingers and the toes in people with oral-facial-digital syndrome. these abnormalities include fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly), digits that are shorter than usual (brachydactyly), or digits that are unusually curved (clinodactyly). the presence of extra digits (polydactyly) is also seen in most forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome.  other features occur in only one or a few types of oral-facial digital syndrome. these features help distinguish the different forms of the disorder. for example, the most common form of oral-facial-digital syndrome, type i, is associated with polycystic kidney disease. this kidney disease is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled sacs (cysts) that interfere with the kidneys' ability to filter waste products from the blood. other forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome are characterized by neurological problems, particular changes in the structure of the brain, bone abnormalities, vision loss, and heart defects."

what are the treatments for gallstones ?,"if gallstones are not causing symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. however, if a person has a gallbladder attack or other symptoms, a health care provider will usually recommend treatment. a person may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesfor treatment. if a person has had one gallbladder attack, more episodes will likely follow.
                
the usual treatment for gallstones is surgery to remove the gallbladder. if a person cannot undergo surgery, nonsurgical treatments may be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. a health care provider may use ercp to remove stones in people who cannot undergo surgery or to remove stones from the common bile duct in people who are about to have gallbladder removal surgery.
                
surgery
                
surgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, is one of the most common operations performed on adults in the united states.
                
the gallbladder is not an essential organ, which means a person can live normally without a gallbladder. once the gallbladder is removed, bile  flows out of the liver through the hepatic and common bile ducts and directly into the duodenum, instead of being stored in the gallbladder.
                
surgeons perform two types of cholecystectomy:
                
-  laparoscopic cholecystectomy. in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the surgeon makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. the camera sends a magni fied image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of organs and tissues. while watching the monitor, the surgeon uses instruments to carefully separate the gallbladder from the liver, bile ducts, and other structures. then the surgeon removes the gallbladder through one of the small incisions. patients usually receive general anesthesia.   most cholecystectomies are performed with laparoscopy. many laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed on an outpatient basis, meaning the person is able to go home the same day. normal physical activity can usually be resumed in about a week.3   -  open cholecystectomy. an open cholecystectomy is performed when the gallbladder is severely infl amed, infected, or scarred from other operations. in most of these cases, open cholecystectomy is planned from the start. however, a surgeon may perform an open cholecystectomy when problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. in these cases, the surgeon must switch to open cholecystectomy as a safety measure for the patient.   to perform an open cholecystectomy, the surgeon creates an incision about 4 to 6 inches long in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder.4 patients usually receive general anesthesia. recovery from open cholecystectomy may require some people to stay in the hospital for up to a week. normal physical activity can usually be resumed after about a month.3
                
a small number of people have softer and more frequent stools after gallbladder removal because bile fl ows into the duodenum more often. changes in bowel habits are usually temporary; however, they should be discussed with a health care provider.
                
though complications from gallbladder surgery are rare, the most common complication is injury to the bile ducts. an injured common bile duct can leak bile and cause a painful and possibly dangerous infection. one or more additional operations may be needed to repair the bile ducts. bile duct injuries occur in less than 1 percent of cholecystectomies.5
                
nonsurgical treatments for cholesterol gallstones
                
nonsurgical treatments are used only in special situations, such as when a person with cholesterol stones has a serious medical condition that prevents surgery. gallstones often recur within 5 years after nonsurgical treatment.6
                
two types of nonsurgical treatments can be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones:
                
- oral dissolution therapy. ursodiol (actigall) and chenodiol (chenix) are medications that contain bile acids that can dissolve gallstones. these medications are most effective in dissolving small cholesterol stones. months or years of treatment may be needed to dissolve all stones.   - shock wave lithotripsy. a machine called a lithotripter is used to crush the gallstone. the lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the persons body to break the gallstone into smaller pieces. this procedure is used only rarely and may be used along with ursodiol."
what is (are) lymphatic filariasis ?,"lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms that only live in the human lymph system, which maintains the body's fluid balance and fights infections. it is spread from person to person by mosquitoes. most infected people are asymptomatic and never develop clinical symptoms. a small percentage of people develop lymphedema, which may affect the legs, arms, breasts, and genitalia; bacterial infections that cause hardening and thickening of the skin, called elephantiasis; hydrocele (swelling of the scrotum) in men; and pulmonary tropical eosinophilia syndrome. treatment may include a yearly dose of medicine, called diethylcarbamazine (dec); while this drug does not kill all of the adult worms, it prevents infected people from giving the disease to someone else."
how to diagnose cough ?,"your doctor will diagnose the cause of your cough based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.
                
medical history
                
your doctor will likely ask questions about your cough. he or she may ask how long you've had it, whether you're coughing anything up (such as mucus, a slimy substance), and how much you cough.
                
your doctor also may ask:
                
about your medical history, including whether you have allergies, asthma, or other medical conditions.
                
whether you have heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. these may be signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).
                
whether you've recently had a cold or the flu.
                
whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke.
                
whether you've been around air pollution, a lot of dust, or fumes.
                
physical exam
                
to check for signs of problems related to cough, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. he or she will listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds.
                
diagnostic tests
                
your doctor may recommend tests based on the results of your medical history and physical exam. for example, if you have symptoms of gerd, your doctor may recommend a ph probe. this test measures the acid level of the fluid in your throat.
                
other tests may include:
                
an exam of the mucus from your nose or throat. this test can show whether you have a bacterial infection.
                
a chest x ray. a chest x ray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. this test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer.
                
lung function tests. these tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. lung function tests can help diagnose asthma and other conditions.
                
an x ray of the sinuses. this test can help diagnose a sinus infection."
what is (are) ulcerative colitis ?,"ulcerative colitis is a chronic disorder that affects the digestive system. this condition is characterized by abnormal inflammation of the inner surface of the rectum and colon, which make up most of the length of the large intestine. the inflammation usually causes open sores (ulcers) to develop in the large intestine. ulcerative colitis usually appears between ages 15 and 30, although it can develop at any age. the inflammation tends to flare up multiple times throughout life, which causes recurring signs and symptoms.  the most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are abdominal pain and cramping and frequent diarrhea, often with blood, pus, or mucus in the stool. other signs and symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and fevers. chronic bleeding from the inflamed and ulcerated intestinal tissue can cause a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) in some affected individuals. people with this disorder have difficulty absorbing enough fluids and nutrients from their diet and often experience weight loss. affected children usually grow more slowly than normal. less commonly, ulcerative colitis causes problems with the skin, joints, eyes, kidneys, or liver, which are most likely due to abnormal inflammation.  toxic megacolon is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis that can be life-threatening. toxic megacolon involves widening of the colon and an overwhelming bacterial infection (sepsis). ulcerative colitis also increases the risk of developing colon cancer, especially in people whose entire colon is inflamed and in people who have had ulcerative colitis for 8 or more years.  ulcerative colitis is one common form of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). another type of ibd, crohn disease, also causes chronic inflammation of the intestines. unlike ulcerative colitis, which affects only the inner surface of the large intestine, crohn disease can cause inflammation in any part of the digestive system, and the inflammation extends deeper into the intestinal tissue."
how to diagnose cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?,how is cryptogenic organizing pneumonia diagnosed? a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms once other conditions that cause similar features have been excluded. this includes ruling out other known causes of organizing pneumonia. additional testing such as a computed tomography (ct) scan or lung biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.

what causes congenital anosmia ?,"what causes congenital anosmia? congenital anosmia may occur as an isolated abnormality or be associated with specific genetic disorders (such as kallmann syndrome and congenital insensitivity to pain). most cases of isolated congenital anosmia (not associated with additional symptoms) occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. in these people, the exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. most likely, there is more than one cause. scientists suspect that the condition occurs due to abnormal development of the olfactory system (the sensory system used for sense of smell) prior to birth. this may include abnormalities of the nasal cavity, disruptions in the pathway that carries information from the nose to the brain, and/or malformations of the portion of the brain that processes sense of smell. rarely, isolated congenital anosmia can affect more than one family member. this suggests that there may be a genetic component in some cases. one study found that some people affected by isolated congenital anosmia have changes (mutations) in prokr2 or prok2, two genes that have previously been reported in people with kallmann syndrome (an inherited condition associated with congenital anosmia and other symptoms). to date, no other disease-causing genes have been identified."

what are the symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever (rmsf) ?,"the first symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever (rmsf) typically begin 2-14 days after the bite of an infected tick. a tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop rmsf do not remember being bitten. the disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of rmsf is made and correct treatment begins. the following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
 
 - fever  
 - rash (occurs 2-5 days after fever, may be absent in some cases; see below) 
 - headache  
 - nausea  
 - vomiting  
 - abdominal pain (may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain)  
 - muscle pain  
 - lack of appetite  
 - conjunctival injection (red eyes)  
 
                
rmsf is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. the progression of the disease varies greatly. patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. 
                
 
rash 
                
while most people with rmsf (90%) have some type of rash during the course of illness, some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process, after treatment should have already begun.  approximately 10% of rmsf patients never develop a rash. it is important for physicians to consider rmsf if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present. 
                
a classic case of rmsf involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles.  often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed. 
                
the red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of rmsf is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. this is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop.

long-term health problems 
                
patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. the damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a ""vasculitis"", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months. 
                
 
infection in children 
                
children with rmsf infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with rmsf are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis.

physician diagnosis 
                
there are several aspects of rmsf that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. the symptoms of rmsf vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment. 
                
for this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. the healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of rmsf but may not be present in all patients. after a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of rmsf. 
  
  
   
  
 
                
 
laboratory confirmation 
                
r. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. for this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or culture. if the patient has a rash, pcr or immunohistochemical (ihc) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. this test can often deliver a rapid result. these tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. pcr, culture, and ihc can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. culture of r. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect r. rickettsii. 
                
during rmsf infection, a patient’s immune system develops antibodies to r. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. it is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out rmsf as a cause of illness. 
                
the gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of rmsf is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa) with r. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. the first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. in most rmsf cases, the first igg ifa titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in igg antibody levels. igm antibodies usually rise at the same time as igg near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. also, igm antibodies are less specific than igg antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. for these reasons, physicians requesting igm serologic titers should also request a concurrent igg titer. 
                
both igm and igg levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to r. rickettsii or similar organisms. therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of rmsf. for more in-depth information about testing, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm 
                
 
treatment 
                
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever rmsf is suspected.  
                
use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop. 
                
if the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. in fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be rmsf. severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented. 
                
recommended dosage
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
 
 - adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
 - children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days. 
treating children 
                
the use of doxycycline to treat suspected rmsf in children is standard practice recommended by both cdc and the aap committee on infectious diseases. use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat rmsf has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected rocky mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages. 
other treatments 
                
in cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of rmsf appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the united states, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and grey baby syndrome. furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against r. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection. 
prophylaxis (preventive treatment) 
                
antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent rmsf. there is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

other considerations 
                
the clinical presentation for rmsf can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. similar to rmsf, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. for more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm"

what is (are) sarcoidosis ?,"espaol
                
sarcoidosis (sar-koy-do-sis) is a disease of unknown cause that leads to inflammation. this disease affects your bodys organs.
                
normally, your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances. for example, it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger.
                
these cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance. inflammation occurs during this process. once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away.
                
in people who have sarcoidosis, the inflammation doesn't go away. instead, some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas (gran-yu-lo-mas) in various organs in your body.
                
overview
                
sarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. however, it's more likely to affect some organs than others. the disease usually starts in the lungs, skin, and/or lymph nodes (especially the lymph nodes in your chest).
                
also, the disease often affects the eyes and liver. although less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain, leading to serious complications.
                
if many granulomas form in an organ, they can affect how the organ works. this can cause signs and symptoms. signs and symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. many people who have sarcoidosis have no signs or symptoms or mild ones.
                
lofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that is typical in some people who have sarcoidosis. lofgren's syndrome may cause fever, enlarged lymph nodes, arthritis (usually in the ankles), and/or erythema nodosum (er-ih-the-ma no-do-sum).
                
erythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. the rash may be warm and tender to the touch.
                
treatment for sarcoidosis varies depending on which organs are affected. your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease. not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment.
                
outlook
                
the outlook for sarcoidosis varies. many people recover from the disease with few or no long-term problems.
                
more than half of the people who have sarcoidosis have remission within 3 years of diagnosis. remission means the disease isn't active, but it can return.
                
two-thirds of people who have the disease have remission within 10 years of diagnosis. people who have lofgren's syndrome usually have remission. relapse (return of the disease) 1 or more years after remission occurs in less than 5 percent of patients.
                
sarcoidosis leads to organ damage in about one-third of the people diagnosed with the disease. damage may occur over many years and involve more than one organ. rarely, sarcoidosis can be fatal. death usually is the result of problems with the lungs, heart, or brain.
                
poor outcomes are more likely in people who have advanced disease and show little improvement from treatment.
                
certain people are at higher risk for poor outcomes from chronic (long-term) sarcoidosis. this includes people who have lung scarring, heart or brain complications, or lupus pernio (lu-pus pur-ne-o). lupus pernio is a serious skin condition that sarcoidosis may cause.
                
research is ongoing for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis."

what is (are) problems with taste ?,"taste, or gustation, is one of our most robust senses. although there is a small decline in taste in people over 60, most older people will not notice it because normal aging does not greatly affect our sense of taste. problems with taste occur less frequently than problems with smell. how our sense of taste works our sense of taste, along with our sense of smell, is part of our chemical sensing system. normal taste occurs when tiny molecules released by chewing or the digestion of food stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat. these taste cells, or gustatory cells, send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain, where specific tastes are identified. damage to these nerves following head injury can lead to taste loss. the taste cells are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and along the lining of the throat. many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tip of the tongue contain taste buds. at birth, we have about 10,000 taste buds scattered on the back, sides, and tip of the tongue. after age 50, we may start to lose taste buds. five taste sensations we can experience five basic taste sensations: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, or savory. umami is the taste we get from glutamate, a building block of protein found in chicken broth, meat stock, and some cheeses. umami is also the taste associated wtih msg (monosodium glutamate) that is often added to foods as a flavor enhancer. the five taste qualities combine with other oral sensations, such as texture, spiciness, temperature, and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor. it is flavor that lets us know whether we are eating an apple or a pear. flavors and the sense of smell many people are surprised to learn that we recognize flavors largely through our sense of smell. try holding your nose while eating chocolate. you will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness, but you can't identify the chocolate flavor. that's because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing. food flavor is affected by a head cold or nasal congestion because the aroma of food does not reach the sensory cells that detect odors. more information on this topic can be found in the topic problems with smell  smell and taste closely linked smell and taste are closely linked senses. many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste, when they are really experiencing a problem with smell. it is common for people who lose their sense of smell to say that food has lost its taste. this is incorrect; the food has lost its aroma, but taste remains. in older people, there is a normal decline in the sense of smell and the taste of food shifts toward blandness. this is why people often believe they have a taste problem. when taste is impaired problems with taste can have a big impact on an older person's life. because taste affects the amount and type of food we eat, when there are problems with taste, a person may change his or her eating habits. some people may eat too much and gain weight, while others may eat too little and lose weight. a loss of appetite, especially in older adults, can lead to loss of weight, poor nutrition, weakened immunity, and even death. taste helps us detect spoiled food or liquids and it also helps some people detect ingredients they are allergic to. a problem with taste can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted. a distorted sense of taste can be a serious risk factor for illnesses that require sticking to a specific diet. loss of taste can cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better. this can be a problem for people with such illnesses as diabetes or high blood pressure. in severe cases, loss of taste can lead to depression. taste problems are often temporary when an older person has a problem with taste, it is often temporary and minor. true taste disorders are uncommon. when a problem with taste exists, it is usually caused by medications, disease, some cancer treatments, or injury. many older people believe that there is nothing they can do about their weakened sense of taste. if you think you have a problem with your sense of taste, see your doctor. depending on the cause of your problem, your doctor may be able to suggest ways to regain your sense of taste or to cope with the loss of taste."

what causes immunodeficiency with hyper igm type 1 ?,"what causes hyper igm syndrome? a flawed gene (or genes) in t-cells (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system and helps the body fight diseases or harmful substances) is responsible for hyper igm syndrome. the faulty t-cells do not give b-cells a signal they need to switch from making igm to iga and igg. most cases (approximately 70%) of hyper-igm syndrome are linked to a recessive mutation on the x chromosome. these cases are inherited as an x-linked recessive genetic trait. because males do not have a second, healthy, x-chromosome to offset the disease, boys far out number girls with this disease. a small number of cases of hyper igm syndrome have been attributed to autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant genetic inheritance. in addition, a rare acquired form of the disorder has been described in the medical literature."
what are the genetic changes related to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency ?,"mutations in the cps1 gene cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency. the cps1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i. this enzyme participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of biochemical reactions that occurs in liver cells. the urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is broken down by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. the specific role of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i enzyme is to control the first step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be processed.  carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. in this condition, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i enzyme is at low levels (deficient) or absent, and the urea cycle cannot proceed normally. as a result, nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of toxic ammonia instead of being converted to less toxic urea and excreted. ammonia is especially damaging to the brain, and excess ammonia causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i deficiency."
what are the symptoms of basilar migraine ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of basilar migraine? episodes of basilar migraines usually begin with an aura, which is a group of symptoms that serve as a warning sign that a bad headache is coming. signs and symptoms of an aura vary, but may include: dizziness and vertigo disorientation double vision and other visual changes tinnitus loss of balance confusion dysarthria fainting loss of consciousness these symptoms can last any where from two minutes to over an hour. they are then followed by a throbbing headache which is often along the back of the head and nausea. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for basilar migraine. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) aphasia - apraxia - autosomal dominant inheritance - blurred vision - coma - confusion - diplopia - drowsiness - dysarthria - dysphasia - episodic ataxia - fever - hemiparesis - hemiplegia - incomplete penetrance - intellectual disability - migraine with aura - seizures - transient unilateral blurring of vision - vertigo - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common. what are the signs and symptoms of a basilar migraine? episodes of basilar migraines usually begin with an aura, which is a group of symptoms that serve as a warning sign that a bad headache is coming. signs and symptoms of an aura vary, but may include: dizziness and vertigo disorientation double vision and other visual changes tinnitus loss of balance confusion dysarthria fainting loss of consciousness these symptoms can last any where from two minutes to over an hour. they are then followed by a throbbing headache which is often along the back of the head and nausea."
what is (are) kleefstra syndrome ?,"kleefstra syndrome is a disorder that involves many parts of the body. characteristic features of kleefstra syndrome include developmental delay and intellectual disability, severely limited or absent speech, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). affected individuals also have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and a wide, short skull (brachycephaly). distinctive facial features include eyebrows that grow together in the middle (synophrys), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), nostrils that open to the front rather than downward (anteverted nares), a protruding jaw (prognathism), rolled out (everted) lips, and a large tongue (macroglossia). affected individuals may have a high birth weight and childhood obesity.  people with kleefstra syndrome may also have structural brain abnormalities, congenital heart defects, genitourinary abnormalities, seizures, and a tendency to develop severe respiratory infections. during childhood they may exhibit features of autism or related developmental disorders affecting communication and social interaction. in adolescence, they may develop a general loss of interest and enthusiasm (apathy) or unresponsiveness (catatonia)."
what is (are) myh9-related disorder ?,"myh9-related disorder is a condition that can have many signs and symptoms, including bleeding problems, hearing loss, kidney (renal) disease, and clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts).  the bleeding problems in people with myh9-related disorder are due to thrombocytopenia. thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. people with myh9-related disorder typically experience easy bruising, and affected women have excessive bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia). the platelets in people with myh9-related disorder are larger than normal. these enlarged platelets have difficulty moving into tiny blood vessels like capillaries. as a result, the platelet level is even lower in these small vessels, further impairing clotting.  some people with myh9-related disorder develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). hearing loss may be present from birth or can develop anytime into late adulthood.  an estimated 30 to 70 percent of people with myh9-related disorder develop renal disease, usually beginning in early adulthood. the first sign of renal disease in myh9-related disorder is typically protein or blood in the urine. renal disease in these individuals particularly affects structures called glomeruli, which are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. the resulting damage to the kidneys can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (esrd).  some affected individuals develop cataracts in early adulthood that worsen over time.  not everyone with myh9-related disorder has all of the major features. all individuals with myh9-related disorder have thrombocytopenia and enlarged platelets. most commonly, affected individuals will also have hearing loss and renal disease. cataracts are the least common sign of this disorder.  myh9-related disorder was previously thought to be four separate disorders: may-hegglin anomaly, epstein syndrome, fechtner syndrome, and sebastian syndrome. all of these disorders involved thrombocytopenia and enlarged platelets and were distinguished by some combination of hearing loss, renal disease, and cataracts. when it was discovered that these four conditions all had the same genetic cause, they were combined and renamed myh9-related disorder."

what is (are) tracheobronchomalacia ?,"tracheobronchomalacia (tbm) is a rare condition that occurs when the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi) are weak. this can cause the airway to become narrow or collapse. there are two forms of tbm: a congenital form (called primary tbm) that typically develops during infancy or early childhood and an acquired form (called secondary tbm) that is usually seen in adults. some affected people may initially have no signs or symptoms. however, the condition is typically progressive (becomes worse overtime) and most people will eventually develop characteristic features such as shortness of breath, cough, sputum retention (inability to clear mucus from the respiratory tract), and wheezing or stridor with breathing. most cases of primary tbm are caused by genetic conditions that weaken the walls of the airway, while the secondary form often occurs incidentally due to trauma, chronic inflammation and/or prolonged compression of the airways. treatment is generally only required in those who have signs and symptoms of the condition and may include stenting, surgical correction, continuous positive airway pressure (cpap), and tracheostomy."
what are the treatments for duane syndrome type 1 ?,"how might duane syndrome type 1 be treated? management of duane syndrome is mainly supportive. it may involve treatment of amblyopia (""lazy eye""); wearing glasses or contact lenses; the use of prisms to correct for abnormal head posture; or possible eye muscle surgery. the majority of people with duane syndrome do not need surgery. however, surgery may be indicated if necessary to reduce severe misalignment of the eyes (strabismus); improve an unacceptable head position; treat a significant upshoot or downshoot; or fix displacement of the eyeball within the orbit (enophthalmos). unfortunately, surgery does not restore function to the affected nerve and muscle, and no surgical technique has been completely successful in eliminating the abnormal eye movements. surgery for duane syndrome usually involves adjusting the other eye muscles to compensate and allow for better eye alignment. while it cannot fix the underlying problem, it can substantially improve signs or symptoms. some surgical procedures or combinations of procedures may be successful in improving or eliminating head turns and strabismus."
what are the treatments for citrullinemia type i ?,"what happens when citrullinemia type i is not treated?  untreated individuals with the severe form of citrullinemia type i have hyperammonemia (plasma ammonia concentration 1000-3000 mol/l). without prompt intervention, hyperammonemia and the accumulation of other toxic metabolites result in swelling of the brain, breathing problems, increased or decreased muscle tone, muscle weakness, problems staying warm, seizures, loss of consciousness, and sometimes death. without treatment, most babies die within the first few weeks of life."

what are the genetic changes related to loeys-dietz syndrome ?,"the four types of loeys-dietz syndrome are distinguished by their genetic cause: mutations in the tgfbr1 gene cause type i, mutations in the tgfbr2 gene cause type ii, mutations in the smad3 gene cause type iii, and mutations in the tgfb2 gene cause type iv. these four genes play a role in cell signaling that promotes growth and development of the body's tissues. this signaling pathway also helps with bone and blood vessel development and plays a part in the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.  mutations in the tgfbr1, tgfbr2, tgfb2, and smad3 genes result in the production of proteins with little or no function. even though these proteins have severely reduced function, cell signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. researchers speculate that the activity of proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the protein whose function is reduced; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. the overactive signaling pathway disrupts the development of connective tissue, the extracellular matrix, and various body systems, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of loeys-dietz syndrome."

what is (are) bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome ?,"bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a large head size (macrocephaly), multiple noncancerous tumors and tumor-like growths called hamartomas, and dark freckles on the penis in males. the signs and symptoms of bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome are present from birth or become apparent in early childhood.  at least half of affected infants have macrocephaly, and many also have a high birth weight and a large body size (macrosomia). growth usually slows during childhood, so affected adults are of normal height and body size. about half of all children with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome have intellectual disability or delayed development, particularly the development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. these delays may improve with age.  about half of all people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome develop hamartomas in their intestines, known as hamartomatous polyps. other noncancerous growths often associated with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome include fatty tumors called lipomas and angiolipomas that develop under the skin. some affected individuals also develop hemangiomas, which are red or purplish growths that consist of tangles of abnormal blood vessels. people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome may also have an increased risk of developing certain cancers, although researchers are still working to determine the cancer risks associated with this condition.  other signs and symptoms that have been reported in people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome include weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and other muscle abnormalities, thyroid problems, and seizures. skeletal abnormalities have also been described with this condition, including an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum).  the features of bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome overlap with those of another disorder called cowden syndrome. people with cowden syndrome develop hamartomas and other noncancerous growths; they also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. both conditions can be caused by mutations in the pten gene. some people with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome have had relatives diagnosed with cowden syndrome, and other individuals have had the characteristic features of both conditions. based on these similarities, researchers have proposed that bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome and cowden syndrome represent a spectrum of overlapping features known as pten hamartoma tumor syndrome instead of two distinct conditions."
what are the genetic changes related to deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency ?,"the dguok gene provides instructions for making the enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase. this enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. mitochondria each contain a small amount of dna, known as mitochondrial dna or mtdna, which is essential for the normal function of these structures. deoxyguanosine kinase is involved in producing and maintaining the building blocks of mitochondrial dna.  mutations in the dguok gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the deoxyguanosine kinase enzyme. reduced enzyme activity leads to problems with the production and maintenance of mitochondrial dna. a reduction in the amount of mitochondrial dna (known as mitochondrial dna depletion) impairs mitochondrial function in many of the body's cells and tissues. these problems lead to the neurological and liver dysfunction associated with deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency."

do you have information about birth weight,"summary : birth weight is the first weight of your baby, taken just after he or she is born. a low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds. a high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.    a low birth weight baby can be born too small, too early (premature), or both. this can happen for many different reasons. they include health problems in the mother, genetic factors, problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.    some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.    high birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big, or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy. these babies may be at a higher risk of birth injuries and problems with blood sugar.    centers for disease control and prevention"
what are the symptoms of shingles ?,"the first symptoms usually include burning, itching, or tingling sensations on the back, chest, or around the rib cage or waist. in other cases, it can be the face or eye area that is involved. the affected area can become extremely painful. this is when most people go to a healthcare provider to find out what is causing the pain. some people report feeling feverish and weak during the early stages. usually within 48 to 72 hours, a red, blotchy rash develops on the affected area. the rash erupts into small blisters that look like chickenpox. the blisters tend to be clustered in one specific area, rather than being scattered all over the body like chickenpox. the torso or face are the parts most likely to be affected, but on occasion, shingles breaks out in the lower body. the burning sensation in the rash area is often accompanied by shooting pains. after the blisters erupt, the open sores take a week or two to crust over. the sores are usually gone within another two weeks. the pain may diminish somewhat, but it often continues for months -- and can go on for years."

what causes myh-associated polyposis ?,"what causes myh-associated polyposis? mutations in the myh gene cause myh-associated polyposis. mutations in this gene prevent cells from correcting mistakes that are made when dna is copied (dna replication) in preparation for cell division. as these mistakes build up in a person's dna, the likelihood of cell overgrowth increases, leading to colon polyps and the possibility of colon cancer."
is adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to robinow syndrome ?,"autosomal recessive robinow syndrome results from mutations in the ror2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood, although it is involved in chemical signaling pathways that are essential for normal development before birth. in particular, the ror2 protein appears to play a critical role in the formation of the skeleton, heart, and genitals. mutations in the ror2 gene prevent cells from making any functional ror2 protein, which disrupts development starting before birth and leads to the characteristic features of robinow syndrome.  autosomal dominant robinow syndrome can be caused by mutations in the wnt5a or dvl1 gene, with the osteosclerotic form of the condition resulting from dvl1 gene mutations. the proteins produced from these genes appear to be part of the same chemical signaling pathways as the ror2 protein. mutations in either of these genes alter the production or function of their respective proteins, which impairs chemical signaling that is important for early development.  some people with the characteristic signs and symptoms of robinow syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the ror2, wnt5a, or dvl1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

what are the symptoms of congenital heart defects ?,"many congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. a doctor may not even detect signs of a heart defect during a physical exam.
                
some heart defects do cause signs and symptoms. they depend on the number, type, and severity of the defects. severe defects can cause signs and symptoms, usually in newborns. these signs and symptoms may include:
                
rapid breathing
                
cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails)
                
fatigue (tiredness)
                
poor blood circulation
                
congenital heart defects don't cause chest pain or other painful symptoms.
                
heart defects can cause heart murmurs (extra or unusual sounds heard during a heartbeat). doctors can hear heart murmurs using a stethoscope. however, not all murmurs are signs of congenital heart defects. many healthy children have heart murmurs.
                
normal growth and development depend on a normal workload for the heart and normal flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body. babies who have congenital heart defects may have cyanosis and tire easily while feeding. as a result, they may not gain weight or grow as they should.
                
older children who have congenital heart defects may get tired easily or short of breath during physical activity.
                
many types of congenital heart defects cause the heart to work harder than it should. with severe defects, this can lead to heart failure. heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. symptoms of heart failure include:
                
shortness of breath or trouble breathing
                
fatigue with physical activity

what are the genetic changes related to renal tubular acidosis with deafness ?,"renal tubular acidosis with deafness is caused by mutations in the atp6v1b1 or atp6v0a4 gene. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are parts (subunits) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar h+-atpase (v-atpase). v-atpases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. because acids are substances that can ""donate"" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (ph) of cells and their surrounding environment. tight control of ph is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.  the v-atpase that includes subunits produced from the atp6v1b1 and atp6v0a4 genes is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. the v-atpase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper ph of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).  mutations in the atp6v1b1 or atp6v0a4 gene impair the function of the v-atpase complex and reduce the body's capability to control the ph of the blood and the fluid in the inner ear, resulting in the signs and symptoms of renal tubular acidosis with deafness."
what are the symptoms of juvenile primary lateral sclerosis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of juvenile primary lateral sclerosis? juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the arms, legs, and face. symptoms of juvenile primary lateral sclerosis begin in early childhood and progress over a period of 15 to 20 years. early symptoms include clumsiness, muscle spasms, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and difficulty with balance. as symptoms progress, they include weakness and stiffness in the arms and hands, slurred speech, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and an inability to walk. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for juvenile primary lateral sclerosis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal pyramidal signs 90% gait disturbance 90% hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% hyperreflexia 90% hypertonia 90% incoordination 90% muscle weakness 90% pseudobulbar signs 90% feeding difficulties in infancy 50% neurological speech impairment 50% abnormality of the urinary system 7.5% skeletal muscle atrophy 7.5% abnormal upper motor neuron morphology - autosomal recessive inheritance - babinski sign - cerebral cortical atrophy - childhood onset - difficulty in tongue movements - dysphagia - juvenile onset - pseudobulbar behavioral symptoms - saccadic smooth pursuit - slow progression - spastic dysarthria - spastic gait - spastic tetraparesis - spasticity of facial muscles - spasticity of pharyngeal muscles - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) hereditary folate malabsorption ?,"hereditary folate malabsorption is a disorder that interferes with the body's ability to absorb certain b vitamins (called folates) from food. folates are important for many cell functions, including the production of dna and its chemical cousin, rna.  infants with hereditary folate malabsorption are born with normal amounts of folates in their body because they obtain these vitamins from their mother's blood before birth. they generally begin to show signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first few months of life because their ability to absorb folates from food is impaired.  infants with hereditary folate malabsorption experience feeding difficulties, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). affected individuals usually develop a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic). the symptoms of this blood disorder may include decreased appetite, lack of energy, headaches, pale skin, and tingling or numbness in the hands and feet. people with hereditary folate malabsorption may also have a deficiency of white blood cells (leukopenia), leading to increased susceptibility to infections. in addition, they may have a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.  some infants with hereditary folate malabsorption exhibit neurological problems such as developmental delay and seizures. over time, untreated individuals may develop intellectual disability and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia)."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for lung cancer ?,"researchers continue to look at new ways to combine, schedule, and sequence the use of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation to treat lung cancer. today, some of the most promising treatment approaches incorporate precision medicine. this approach first looks to see what genes may be mutated that are causing the cancer, and once these genes are identified, specific drugs may be available that target the mutations and treat the cancer directly without the harsh side-effects often found with conventional chemotherapy. researchers are also constantly trying to come up with new ways to find and diagnose lung cancer in order to catch it and treat it in its earliest stages. the national lung screening trial, or nlst, showed conclusively that spiral ct reduced the risk of dying by 20 percent compared to those who received a chest x-ray among heavy smokers get more information on current lung cancer research."
is acromicric dysplasia inherited ?,"acromicric dysplasia is an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent."

is early-onset glaucoma inherited ?,"early-onset glaucoma can have different inheritance patterns. primary congenital glaucoma is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  juvenile open-angle glaucoma is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some families, primary congenital glaucoma may also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
what are the treatments for congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency ?,"how might congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (csid) be treated? csid is typically treated by modifying a person's diet to reduce the amount of sucrose. because many foods contain sucrose and other complex sugars, it can be difficult to completely remove sucrase from the diet. sucraid is an oral medication containing the enzyme that does not work properly in people with this condition. by taking this medication, those with csid can eat sucrose-containing foods because this enzyme will break down sucrose. this medication must be taken with each meal or snack."
how to prevent kidney stones in adults ?,"the first step in preventing kidney stones is to understand what is causing the stones to form. the health care provider may ask the person to try to catch the kidney stone as it passes, so it can be sent to a lab for analysis. stones that are retrieved surgically can also be sent to a lab for analysis.
                
the health care provider may ask the person to collect urine for 24 hours after a stone has passed or been removed to measure daily urine volume and mineral levels. producing too little urine or having a mineral abnormality can make a person more likely to form stones. kidney stones may be prevented through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition and medications.
                
eating, diet, and nutrition
                
people can help prevent kidney stones by making changes in their fluid intake. depending on the type of kidney stone a person has, changes in the amounts of sodium, animal protein, calcium, and oxalate consumed can also help.
                
drinking enough fluids each day is the best way to help prevent most types of kidney stones. health care providers recommend that a person drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day. people with cystine stones may need to drink even more. though water is best, other fluids may also help prevent kidney stones, such as orange juice or lemonade. talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.
                
recommendations based on the specific type of kidney stone include the following:
                
calcium oxalate stones
                
- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food  - avoiding foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran
                
calcium phosphate stones
                
- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food
                
uric acid stones
                
- limiting animal protein
                
more information about how changes in diet affect kidney stone formation is provided in the niddk health topic, diet for kidney stone prevention.
                
medications
                
the health care provider may prescribe certain medications to help prevent kidney stones based on the type of stone formed or conditions that make a person more prone to form stones:
                
- hyperuricosuriaallopurinol (zyloprim), which decreases uric acid in the blood and urine  - hypercalciuriadiuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide  - hyperoxaluriapotassium citrate to raise the citrate and ph of urine  - uric acid stonesallopurinol and potassium citrate  - cystine stonesmercaptopropionyl glycine, which decreases cystine in the urine, and potassium citrate  - struvite stonesantibiotics, which are bacteria-fighting medications, when needed to treat infections, or acetohydroxamic acid with long-term antibiotic medications to prevent infection
                
people with hyperparathyroidism sometimes develop calcium stones. treatment in these cases is usually surgery to remove the parathyroid glands. in most cases, only one of the glands is enlarged. removing the glands cures hyperparathyroidism and prevents kidney stones."
what are the symptoms of adult central nervous system tumors ?,"the signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person. signs and symptoms depend on the following:         - where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord.    - what the affected part of the brain controls.    - the size of the tumor.        signs and symptoms may be caused by cns tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain. check with your doctor if you have any of the following:      brain tumor symptoms       - morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting.    -  seizures.    - vision, hearing, and speech problems.    - loss of appetite.    - frequent nausea and vomiting.     - changes in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior.    - loss of balance and trouble walking.    - weakness.    - unusual sleepiness or change in activity level.            spinal cord tumor symptoms       - back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs.    - a change in bowel habits or trouble urinating.    - weakness or numbness in the arms or legs.    - trouble walking."
what causes bethlem myopathy ?,"what causes bethlem myopathy? bethlem myopathy is caused by mutations in the col6a1, col6a2, and col6a3 genes. these genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type vi collagen. this protein plays an important role in muscle, particularly skeletal muscle. type vi collagen makes up part of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support to the muscles. mutations in the type vi collagen genes result in the formation of abnormal type vi collagen or reduced amounts of type vi collagen. this decrease in normal type vi collagen disrupts the extracellullar matrix surrounding muscle cells, leading to progressive muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of bethlem myopathy."
what are the symptoms of mycobacterium malmoense ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mycobacterium malmoense infection? many cases of m. malmoense infection cause no symptoms, and as a result go unrecognized. m. malmoense infections in adults often present as lung infections with or without fever. in children, m. malmoense infections can present as a single sided, non-tender, enlarging, neck mass. the mass may be violet in color and often does not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. m. malmoense infection can also cause skin lesions or abscesses."
what are the treatments for childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor ?,"key points
                    - there are different types of treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.    - children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.     - childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.    - some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.     -  four types of treatment are used:         - surgery     - chemotherapy     - radiation therapy     - high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant        - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - targeted therapy        - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (at/rt). treatment for at/rt is usually within a clinical trial. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website. choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with central nervous system cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists:          -  pediatrician.    - pediatric neurosurgeon.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  neurologist.    -  pediatric nurse specialist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.    -  psychologist.    -  social worker.    -  geneticist or genetic counselor.
                
                
                    childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. these signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
                
                
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - physical problems.    - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  second cancers (new types of cancer).        some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information).
                
                
                    four types of treatment are used:
                    surgery     surgery is used to diagnose and treat cns atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. see the general information section of this summary.    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, most patients will be given chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.             - when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor. this is called intrathecal chemotherapy.     - when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). high doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor.              radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread. external radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord.     because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children.        high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.    some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

							                    because atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (at/rt) is fast-growing, a combination of treatments is usually given. after surgery to remove the tumor, treatments for at/rt may include combinations of the following:         - chemotherapy.    -  radiation therapy.    -  high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant.         clinical trials of new treatments should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor."
who is at risk for prostate cancer? ?,"avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:
                    age      prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. the chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.       family history of prostate cancer     a man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.       race     prostate cancer occurs more often in african-american men than in white men. african-american men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.       hormones    the prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. the main male sex hormone is testosterone. testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.    testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (dht) by an enzyme in the body. dht is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.       vitamin e    the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) found that vitamin e taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. the risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin e.       folic acid    folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. however, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.       dairy and calcium    a diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    the following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:
                    folate    folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. however, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.       finasteride and dutasteride     finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. these drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (dht). higher than normal levels of dht may play a part in developing prostate cancer. taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.    the prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. the number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.    the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events trial (reduce) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. the number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).
                
                
                    the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
                    selenium and vitamin e    the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) studied whether taking vitamin e and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. the selenium and vitamin e were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for african-american men). the study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin e together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.       diet    it is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. in the pcpt trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.       multivitamins    regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. however, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.       lycopene    some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. it has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer."

how to prevent parasites - enterobiasis (also known as pinworm infection) ?,"washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food is the most successful way to prevent pinworm infection. in order to stop the spread of pinworm and possible re-infection, people who are infected should bathe every morning to help remove a large amount of the eggs on the skin. showering is a better method than taking a bath, because showering avoids potentially contaminating the bath water with pinworm eggs. infected people should not co-bathe with others during their time of infection.
    
also, infected people should comply with good hygiene practices such as washing their hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. they should also cut fingernails regularly, and avoid biting the nails and scratching around the anus. frequent changing of underclothes and bed linens first thing in the morning is a great way to prevent possible transmission of eggs in the environment and risk of reinfection. these items should not be shaken and carefully placed into a washer and laundered in hot water followed by a hot dryer to kill any eggs that may be there.
    
in institutions, day care centers, and schools, control of pinworm can be difficult, but mass drug administration during an outbreak can be successful. teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.

is multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations inherited ?,"vmcm is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing venous malformations.  some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. these changes, which are not inherited, are called somatic mutations. researchers have discovered that some vmcm lesions have one inherited and one somatic tek gene mutation. it is not known if the somatic mutation occurs before or after the venous malformation forms. as lesions are localized and not all veins are malformed, it is thought that the inherited mutation alone is not enough to cause venous malformations.  in most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition."
what is (are) hirschsprung disease ?,"hirschsprung disease is an intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of nerves in parts of the intestine. this condition occurs when the nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) do not form properly during development before birth (embryonic development). this condition is usually identified in the first two months of life, although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood.  enteric nerves trigger the muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine. without these nerves in parts of the intestine, the material cannot be pushed through, causing severe constipation or complete blockage of the intestine in people with hirschsprung disease. other signs and symptoms of this condition include vomiting, abdominal pain or swelling, diarrhea, poor feeding, malnutrition, and slow growth. people with this disorder are at risk of developing more serious conditions such as inflammation of the intestine (enterocolitis) or a hole in the wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation), which can cause serious infection and may be fatal.  there are two main types of hirschsprung disease, known as short-segment disease and long-segment disease, which are defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells. in short-segment disease, nerve cells are missing from only the last segment of the large intestine. this type is most common, occurring in approximately 80 percent of people with hirschsprung disease. for unknown reasons, short-segment disease is four times more common in men than in women. long-segment disease occurs when nerve cells are missing from most of the large intestine and is the more severe type. long-segment disease is found in approximately 20 percent of people with hirschsprung disease and affects men and women equally. very rarely, nerve cells are missing from the entire large intestine and sometimes part of the small intestine (total colonic aganglionosis) or from all of the large and small intestine (total intestinal aganglionosis).  hirschsprung disease can occur in combination with other conditions, such as waardenburg syndrome, type iv; mowat-wilson syndrome; or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. these cases are described as syndromic. hirschsprung disease can also occur without other conditions, and these cases are referred to as isolated or nonsyndromic."
what is (are) stroke ?,there are two kinds of stroke. the most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. it accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. an ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. the other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.
what is (are) nicolaides-baraitser syndrome ?,"nicolaides-baraitser syndrome is a condition that affects many body systems. affected individuals can have a wide variety of signs and symptoms, but the most common are sparse scalp hair, small head size (microcephaly), distinct facial features, short stature, prominent finger joints, unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and moderate to severe intellectual disability with impaired language development.  in people with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome, the sparse scalp hair is often noticeable in infancy. the amount of hair decreases over time, but the growth rate and texture of the hair that is present is normal. affected adults generally have very little hair. in rare cases, the amount of scalp hair increases over time. as affected individuals age, their eyebrows may become less full, but their eyelashes almost always remain normal. at birth, the hair on the face may be abnormally thick (hypertrichosis) but thins out over time.  most affected individuals grow slowly, resulting in short stature and microcephaly. sometimes, growth before birth is unusually slow.  the characteristic facial features of people with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome include a triangular face, deep-set eyes, a thin nasal bridge, wide nostrils, a pointed nasal tip, and a thick lower lip. many affected individuals have a lack of fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat) of the face, which may cause premature wrinkling. throughout their bodies, people with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome may have pale skin with veins that are visible on the skin surface due to the lack of subcutaneous fat.  in people with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome, a lack of subcutaneous fat in the hands makes the finger joints appear larger than normal. over time, the fingertips become broad and oval shaped. additionally, there is a wide gap between the first and second toes (known as a sandal gap).  most people with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome have epilepsy, which often begins in infancy. affected individuals can experience multiple seizure types, and the seizures can be difficult to control with medication.  almost everyone with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome has moderate to severe intellectual disability. early developmental milestones, such as crawling and walking, are often normally achieved, but further development is limited, and language development is severely impaired. at least one-third of affected individuals never develop speech, while others lose their verbal communication over time. people with this condition are often described as having a happy demeanor and being very friendly, although they can exhibit moments of aggression and temper tantrums.  other signs and symptoms of nicolaides-baraitser syndrome include an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema. about half of individuals with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome have a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). some affected individuals have dental abnormalities such as widely spaced teeth, delayed eruption of teeth, and absent teeth (hypodontia). most affected males have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and females may have underdeveloped breasts. nearly half of individuals with nicolaides-baraitser syndrome have feeding problems."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for dravet syndrome ?,"the ninds conducts and supports a broad program of basic and clinical research on all types of epilepsy, including dravet syndrome. study of the genetic defects responsible for dravet syndrome and related disorders is expected to lead to the development of effective drug therapies."
what is (are) kernicterus ?,"kernicterus is a rare condition that affects the brain. it refers to a form of brain damage that occurs when neonatal jaundice goes untreated for too long. the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person. people living with kernicterus may experience athetoid cerebral palsy, hearing loss, intellectual disability, vision abnormalities, and behavioral difficulties. approximately 60% of all newborn babies will have jaundice, a condition that is characterized by high level of bilirubin in the blood. risk factors for severe jaundice and higher bilirubin levels include premature birth (before 37 weeks); darker skin color; east asian or mediterranean descent; feeding difficulties; jaundice in a sibling; bruising at birth; and a mother with an o blood type or rh negative blood factor. early detection and management of jaundice can prevent kernicterus."
what is (are) parry-romberg ?,"parry-romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive deterioration (atrophy) of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face (hemifacial atrophy), usually the left side. it is more common in females than in males. initial facial changes usually involve the tissues above the upper jaw (maxilla) or between the nose and the upper corner of the lip (nasolabial fold) and subsequently progress to the angle of the mouth, areas around the eye, the brow, the ear, and the neck. the deterioration may also affect the tongue, the soft and fleshy part of the roof of the mouth, and the gums. the eye and cheek of the affected side may become sunken and facial hair may turn white and fall out (alopecia). in addition, the skin overlying affected areas may become darkly pigmented (hyperpigmentation) with, in some cases, areas of hyperpigmentation and patches of unpigmented skin (vitiligo). parry-romberg syndrome is also accompanied by neurological abnormalities including seizures and episodes of severe facial pain (trigeminal neuralgia). the onset of the disease usually begins between the ages of 5 and 15 years. the progression of the atrophy often lasts from 2 to 10 years, and then the process seems to enter a stable phase. muscles in the face may atrophy and there may be bone loss in the facial bones. problems with the retina and optic nerve may occur when the disease surrounds the eye."

what are the stages of non-small cell lung cancer ?,"key points
                    - after lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - the following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer:         - occult (hidden) stage     - stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - stage i     - stage ii     - stage iiia     - stage iiib     - stage iv
                
                
                    after lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. some of the tests used to diagnose non-small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (see the general information section.)    other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:         -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain and abdomen, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   radionuclide bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.     -   pulmonary function test (pft): a test to see how well the lungs are working. it measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. it also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing. this is also called lung function test.    -   endoscopic ultrasound (eus): a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body. an endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. this procedure is also called endosonography. eus may be used to guide fine needle aspiration (fna) biopsy of the lung, lymph nodes, or other areas.     -   mediastinoscopy : a surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. an incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. a mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   anterior mediastinotomy : a surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas. an incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. a mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. this is also called the chamberlain procedure.    -  lymph node biopsy : the removal of all or part of a lymph node. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.     -   bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if non-small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. the disease is metastatic lung cancer, not brain cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer:
                    occult (hidden) stage    in the occult (hidden) stage, cancer cannot be seen by imaging or bronchoscopy. cancer cells are found in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) or bronchial washing (a sample of cells taken from inside the airways that lead to the lung). cancer may have spread to other parts of the body.       stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    in stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the airways. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        stage i     in stage i, cancer has formed. stage i is divided into stages ia and ib:            -  stage ia: the tumor is in the lung only and is 3 centimeters or smaller.     -  stage ib: cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - the tumor is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.       - cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       - cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.                          stage ii    stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib. stage iia and iib are each divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes.            -  stage iia:  (1) cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. the lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. also, one or more of the following is true:                  - the tumor is not larger than 5 centimeters.       -  cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       -  cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.            or  (2) cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.       - cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       - cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.                -  stage iib:  (1) cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. the lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. also, one or more of the following is true:                  - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.       - cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       -  cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.             or (2) cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - the tumor is larger than 7 centimeters.       - cancer has spread to the main bronchus (and is less than 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus), the chest wall, the diaphragm, or the nerve that controls the diaphragm.        - cancer has spread to the membrane around the heart or lining the chest wall.       - the whole lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).       - there are one or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the lung.                         stage iiia     stage iiia is divided into three sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer (if any).

what is (are) krabbe disease ?,"krabbe disease (also called globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a degenerative disorder that affects the nervous system. it is caused by the shortage (deficiency) of an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. this enzyme deficiency impairs the growth and maintenance of myelin, the protective covering around certain nerve cells that ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. krabbe disease is part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies, which result from the loss of myelin (demyelination). this disorder is also characterized by the abnormal presence of globoid cells, which are globe-shaped cells that usually have more than one nucleus.  the symptoms of krabbe disease usually begin before the age of 1 year (the infantile form). initial signs and symptoms typically include irritability, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, episodes of fever without any sign of infection, stiff posture, and slowed mental and physical development. as the disease progresses, muscles continue to weaken, affecting the infant's ability to move, chew, swallow, and breathe. affected infants also experience vision loss and seizures.  less commonly, onset of krabbe disease can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (late-onset forms). visual problems and walking difficulties are the most common initial symptoms in this form of the disorder, however, signs and symptoms vary considerably among affected individuals."
what are the symptoms of penttinen-aula syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of penttinen-aula syndrome? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for penttinen-aula syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) scoliosis 5% wormian bones 5% brachydactyly syndrome - delayed cranial suture closure - delayed eruption of teeth - delayed skeletal maturation - growth abnormality - hyperkeratosis - hypermetropia - hypoplasia of midface - lipoatrophy - narrow nose - osteolytic defects of the phalanges of the hand - osteopenia - proptosis - sensorineural hearing impairment - slender long bone - sparse hair - thin calvarium - thin vermilion border - thyroid-stimulating hormone excess - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) harlequin ichthyosis ?,"harlequin ichthyosis is a severe genetic disorder that mainly affects the skin. infants with this condition are born with very hard, thick skin covering most of their bodies. the skin forms large, diamond-shaped plates that are separated by deep cracks (fissures). these skin abnormalities affect the shape of the eyelids, nose, mouth, and ears, and limit movement of the arms and legs. restricted movement of the chest can lead to breathing difficulties and respiratory failure.  the skin normally forms a protective barrier between the body and its surrounding environment. the skin abnormalities associated with harlequin ichthyosis disrupt this barrier, making it more difficult for affected infants to control water loss, regulate their body temperature, and fight infections. infants with harlequin ichthyosis often experience an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and develop life-threatening infections in the first few weeks of life. it used to be very rare for affected infants to survive the newborn period. however, with intensive medical support and improved treatment, people with this disorder now have a better chance of living into childhood and adolescence."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for glaucoma ?,"through studies in the laboratory and with patients, the national eye institute is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma. for example, researchers have discovered genes that could help explain how glaucoma damages the eye. nei also is supporting studies to learn more about who is likely to get glaucoma, when to treat people who have increased eye pressure, and which treatment to use first."
what are the symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta type ii ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta type ii? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for osteogenesis imperfecta type ii. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - absent ossification of calvaria - autosomal dominant inheritance - beaded ribs - blue sclerae - broad long bones - congestive heart failure - convex nasal ridge - crumpled long bones - disproportionate short-limb short stature - large fontanelles - multiple prenatal fractures - nonimmune hydrops fetalis - platyspondyly - premature birth - pulmonary insufficiency - recurrent fractures - respiratory insufficiency - small for gestational age - thin skin - tibial bowing - wormian bones - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for treatment methods for kidney failure: peritoneal dialysis ?,"your health care team will perform several tests to tell if your dialysis exchanges are removing enough wastes. these tests are especially important during the first weeks of treatment to determine whether your schedule is adequate.
                
peritoneal equilibration test
                
for a peritoneal equilibration test, a dialysis nurse takes samples of your blood and dialysis solution during a 4-hour exchange. the peritoneal equilibration test measures how much dextrose your body absorbs from a bag of dialysis solution. the peritoneal equilibration test also measures how much urea and creatininewaste products of normal muscle and protein breakdownmove from your blood into the dialysis solution.
                
clearance test
                
for a clearance test, you will collect the used dialysis solution from a 24-hour period. a dialysis nurse takes a blood sample during the same 24-hour period. your doctor or nurse compares the amount of urea in the used solution with the amount in your blood to see how much urea was removed. for the first months or even years of peritoneal dialysis treatment, you may still produce small amounts of urine. if you produce more than 100 milliliters (3 ounces) of urine per day, you will also collect your urine to measure its urea content.
                
from the measurements of used solution, blood, and, if available, urine, your health care team can determine your urea clearancea measurement doctors call your kt/vand your creatinine clearance rate. these measurements will show whether you are using the right peritoneal dialysis schedule and doses. if your dialysis schedule is not removing enough wastes, your doctor will make adjustments. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, peritoneal dialysis dose and adequacy."

is hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."
what is (are) actin-accumulation myopathy ?,"actin-accumulation myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. people with actin-accumulation myopathy have severe muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body. signs and symptoms of this condition are apparent in infancy and include feeding and swallowing difficulties, a weak cry, and difficulty with controlling head movements. affected babies are sometimes described as ""floppy"" and may be unable to move on their own.  the severe muscle weakness that occurs in actin-accumulation myopathy also affects the muscles used for breathing. individuals with this disorder may take shallow breaths (hypoventilate), especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. frequent respiratory infections and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur. because of the respiratory problems, most affected individuals do not survive past infancy. those who do survive have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, standing, and walking.  the name actin-accumulation myopathy derives from characteristic accumulations in muscle cells of filaments composed of a protein called actin. these filaments can be seen when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope."
what is (are) mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency ?,"mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency is a rare condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency may begin during infancy or later in life. features that occur during infancy include feeding difficulties, lack of energy (lethargy), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and liver problems. infants with this disorder are also at high risk for serious heart problems, breathing difficulties, coma, and sudden death. signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency that may begin after infancy include hypotonia, muscle pain, a breakdown of muscle tissue, and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy).  problems related to mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. this disorder is sometimes mistaken for reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. most cases of reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections."
what is (are) pierson syndrome ?,"pierson syndrome is a very rare condition that mainly affects the kidneys and eyes. signs and symptoms include congenital nephrotic syndrome and distinct ocular (eye) abnormalities, including microcoria (small pupils that are not responsive to light). most affected children have early-onset, chronic renal failure; neurodevelopmental problems; and blindness. hypotonia (poor muscle tone) and movement disorders have also been reported. pierson syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the lamb2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. the long-term outlook is poor; affected infants may not survive past the first weeks or months of life."
"is blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1 inherited ?","if my daughter inherits bpes from me, will she definitely have the same type as me, or could she have the other type? more than 130 mutations (changes) in the foxl2 gene have been found to cause bpes. it has been reported that mutations that lead to a significantly shortened foxl2 protein often cause bpes type i (characterized by eyelid malformations and premature ovarian failure (pof)), while mutations that result in an extra long foxl2 protein may cause bpes type ii (which involves only eyelid malformations). however, in a study published in 2003 in the american journal of human genetics, the authors discussed how their study was the first to demonstrate intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability (i.e. both bpes types caused by the same mutation). they discuss how assigning an affected family a diagnosis of either bpes type i or ii is not always possible because of this. the article also discusses a previous report of menstrual abnormalities and reduced female fertility in two families with bpes type ii, suggesting overlap between both bpes types, as well as a report of a family with bpes type i in which the first generations of affected females are infertile while three affected young women in the youngest generation appear to have normal pelvic ultrasound and hormone levels. they do caution that in this family, the early age of the affected women may preclude an accurate prediction of whether they will have pof, since the onset of pof usually occurs at a later age. approximately 12 percent of people with bpes do not have an identified foxl2 gene mutation; the cause of the condition in these people is unknown, and therefore there is no information on whether there may be variation within families for these affected individuals."

what are the treatments for eosinophilic enteropathy ?,"how might eosinophilic enteropathy be treated? there is no ""cure"" for eosinophilic enteropathy, but treatment can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further damage to the gastrointestinal tract. treatment of eosinophilic enteropathy varies based on the location of the eosinophils, severity of symptoms, and other medical problems the child or adult may have. in most cases, dietary restrictions and medications can significantly improve the problematic symptoms of this condition. food allergy testing is used as a guide for restriction or elimination diets. an elimination diet means strictly avoiding all foods to which the patient has tested positive on allergy testing. skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets. sometimes a stricter diet, called an elemental diet, is needed. skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets, but it only takes one false negative food for the diet to ""fail"". elemental diets are diets that do not include whole or broken-down forms of protein. instead, special elemental formulas are used, which are made of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), fats, sugars, vitamins and minerals. amino acids do not cause allergic reactions but whole or partial proteins can. children and adults who rely in part, or completely, on an elemental amino acid based formula may have a difficult time drinking enough of the formula. to maintain proper nutrition, some require tube feedings directly into the stomach (enteral feeds). in the most severe cases, nutrition is administered directly into the blood stream (parenteral feeds). the american partnership for eosinophilic disorders provides more information about treatment for eosinophilic enteropathy. this organization also provides more details on restricted or elimination diets and elemental diets."
what are the genetic changes related to muckle-wells syndrome ?,"mutations in the nlrp3 gene (also known as cias1) cause muckle-wells syndrome. the nlrp3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin.  cryopyrin belongs to a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (nlr) proteins. these proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. when this has been accomplished, the body stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.  cryopyrin is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome, which helps trigger the inflammatory process. researchers believe that nlrp3 gene mutations that cause muckle-wells syndrome result in a hyperactive cryopyrin protein and an inappropriate inflammatory response. impairment of the body's mechanisms for controlling inflammation results in the episodes of fever and damage to the body's cells and tissues seen in muckle-wells syndrome."
what is (are) mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration ?,"mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (mpan) is a disorder of the nervous system. the condition typically begins in childhood or early adulthood and worsens (progresses) over time.  mpan commonly begins with difficulty walking. as the condition progresses, affected individuals usually develop other movement problems, including muscle stiffness (spasticity) and involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia). many people with mpan have a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism. these abnormalities include unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, involuntary trembling (tremors), and an inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural instability).  other neurological problems that occur in individuals with mpan include degeneration of the nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy), which can impair vision; problems with speech (dysarthria); difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); and, in later stages of the condition, an inability to control the bowels or the flow of urine (incontinence). additionally, affected individuals may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia) and psychiatric symptoms such as behavioral problems, mood swings, hyperactivity, and depression.  mpan is characterized by an abnormal buildup of iron in certain regions of the brain. because of these deposits, mpan is considered part of a group of conditions known as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (nbia)."
what is (are) occipital neuralgia ?,"occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head. typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. some individuals will also experience pain in the scalp, forehead, and behind the eyes. their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. the location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the scalp at the back of the head. the pain is caused by irritation or injury to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types of lesions in the neck. localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipital neuralgia. in many cases, however, no cause can be found. a positive response (relief from pain) after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis."
how to prevent parasites - schistosomiasis ?,"prevention
    
no vaccine is available.
    
the best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:
    
     - avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.
     - drink safe water. although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. iodine treatment alone will not guarantee that water is safe and free of all parasites.
     - water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.
     - vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. however, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.
    
    
those who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.

   control
   
in countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:
   
    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or
    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite’s life cycle.
   
   
for all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. in some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a ""winnable battle"" by public health officials.
   
control measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:
   
    - chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.
    - for certain species of the parasite, such as s. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources."
how to diagnose gallbladder cancer ?,"tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. procedures that make pictures of the gallbladder and the area around it help diagnose gallbladder cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the gallbladder is called staging.    in order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the gallbladder cancer can be removed by surgery. tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   liver function tests : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. a higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by gallbladder cancer.    -   carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) assay : a test that measures the level of cea in the blood. cea is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. when found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions.    -   ca 19-9 assay : a test that measures the level of ca 19-9 in the blood. ca 19-9 is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. when found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions.    -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. an abdominal ultrasound is done to diagnose gallbladder cancer.    -   ptc (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography): a procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. a thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. if a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body.    -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   ercp (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography): a procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. sometimes gallbladder cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. a catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the bile ducts. a dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. if the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. this tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. tissue samples may also be taken.     -   laparoscopy : a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as removing organs or taking tissue samples for biopsy. the laparoscopy helps to find out if the cancer is within the gallbladder only or has spread to nearby tissues and if it can be removed by surgery.    -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. the biopsy may be done after surgery to remove the tumor. if the tumor clearly cannot be removed by surgery, the biopsy may be done using a fine needle to remove cells from the tumor."
what to do for ulcerative colitis ?,"- ulcerative colitis is a chronic, or long lasting, disease that causes inflammationirritation or swellingand sores called ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine.  - the exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. researchers believe that factors such as an overactive intestinal immune system, genes, and environment may play a role in causing ulcerative colitis.  - ulcerative colitis can occur in people of any age. however, it is more likely to develop in people      - between the ages of 15 and 30    - older than 60    - who have a family member with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)    - of jewish descent    - the most common signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis are diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort.  - a health care provider diagnoses ulcerative colitis with the following:      - medical and family history    - physical exam    - lab tests    - endoscopies of the large intestine    - which treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and symptoms.  - good nutrition is important in the management of ulcerative colitis. a health care provider may recommend that a person make dietary changes.  - people with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer."
what are the genetic changes related to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles ?,"cfeom1 and rare cases of cfeom3 result from mutations in the kif21a gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called a kinesin, which is essential for the transport of materials within cells. researchers believe that this protein plays an important role in the normal development and function of nerves in the head and face. in particular, this protein plays a critical role in the development of a particular branch of cranial nerve iii, which emerges from the brain and controls muscles that raise the eyes and eyelids. mutations in the kif21a gene likely alter the protein's ability to transport materials within nerve cells, preventing the normal development of these cranial nerves and the extraocular muscles they control. abnormal function of the extraocular muscles leads to restricted eye movement and related problems with vision.  mutations in the phox2a gene cause cfeom2. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the developing nervous system. studies suggest that the phox2a protein plays a critical role in the development of cranial nerves iii and iv, which are necessary for normal eye movement. mutations likely eliminate the function of the phox2a protein, which prevents the normal development of these cranial nerves and the extraocular muscles they control.  in most cases of cfeom3, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown. studies suggest that a gene associated with cfeom3 may be located near one end of chromosome 16. the gene associated with tukel syndrome has not been identified either, although researchers think that it may be located near one end of chromosome 21."
what causes adult-onset still's disease ?,"what causes adult-onset still's disease? the cause of adult-onset stills disease is unknown. some hypothesize that the condition results from or is triggered by a virus or other infectious agent. others believe that it is a hypersensitive or autoimmune disorder. to date, no conclusive evidence has been found to prove or disprove either theory."
what is (are) what i need to know about kidney stones ?,"doctors have found four main types of kidney stones:
                
- the most common types of stones contain calcium. calcium is a normal part of a healthy diet. calcium that is not used by the bones and muscles goes to the kidneys. in most people, the kidneys flush out the extra calcium with the rest of the urine. people who have calcium stones keep the calcium in their kidneys. the calcium that stays behind joins with other waste products to form a stone. people can have calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. calcium oxalate stones are more common.  - a uric acid stone may form when the urine contains too much acid. people who eat a lot of meat, fish, and shellfish may get uric acid stones.  - a struvite stone may form after you have a kidney infection.  - cystine stones result from a genetic disorder, meaning a problem passed from parent to child. the disorder causes cystine to leak through the kidneys and into the urine."
what are the treatments for huntington's disease ?,"there is no treatment that can stop or reverse the course of hd. tetrabenazine is prescribed for treating huntingtons-associated chorea. it is the only drug approved by the u.s. food and drug administration specifically for use against hd. antipsychotic drugs may help to alleviate chorea and may also be used to help control hallucinations, delusions, and violent outbursts. drugs may be prescribed to treat depression and anxiety. drugs used to treat the symptoms of hd may have side effects such as fatigue, sedation, decreased concentration, restlessness, or hyperexcitability, and should be only used when symptoms create problems for the individual."
what is (are) dwarfism ?,"dwarfism is a condition that is characterized by short stature, usually resulting in an adult height of 4'10"" or shorter. dwarfism can and most often does occur in families where both parents are of average height. it can be caused by any one of more than 300 conditions, most of which are genetic. the most common type, accounting for 70% of all cases of short stature, is called achondroplasia. other genetic conditions, kidney disease and problems with metabolism or hormones can also cause short stature. dwarfism itself is not a disease; however, there is a greater risk of some health problems. with proper medical care, most people with dwarfism have active lives and a normal life expectancy."
what is (are) x-linked thrombocytopenia ?,"x-linked thrombocytopenia is a bleeding disorder that primarily affects males. this condition is characterized by a blood cell abnormality called thrombocytopenia, which is a shortage in the number of cells involved in clotting (platelets). affected individuals often have abnormally small platelets as well, a condition called microthrombocytopenia. x-linked thrombocytopenia can cause individuals to bruise easily or have episodes of prolonged bleeding following minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). some people with this condition experience spontaneous bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage), which can cause brain damage that can be life-threatening.  some people with x-linked thrombocytopenia also have patches of red, irritated skin (eczema) or an increased susceptibility to infections. in severe cases, additional features can develop, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. it is unclear, however, if people with these features have x-linked thrombocytopenia or a more severe disorder with similar signs and symptoms called wiskott-aldrich syndrome.  some people have a mild form of the disorder called intermittent thrombocytopenia. these individuals have normal platelet production at times with episodes of thrombocytopenia."
how to diagnose reticulohistiocytoma ?,"how is reticulohistiocytoma diagnosed? the diagnosis of reticulohistiocytoma (rh) is made based on clinical presentation, histology, and immunohistochemistry profile. rh occur in isolation and are typically described as small, yellow to reddish-born nodules. the lesions usually are slightly elevated from the surrounding skin. detailed information on histology of reticulohistiocytoma is available through dermnet nz, an online resource about skin diseases developed by the new zealand dermatological society incorporated. there are several differential diagnoses for rh. it is important to distinguish rh from rosai-dorfman disease, juvenile xanthogranuloma, a variety of granulomatous conditions, and some malignant neoplasms, including histiocytic sarcoma, melanoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. reticulohistiocytoma should also be distinguished from multicentric reticulohistiocytosis."
what is (are) pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 ?,"pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (pch2) is a rare condition that affects the development of the brain. signs and symptoms vary but may include microcephaly, developmental delay with lack of voluntary motor development, intellectual disability and movement disorders (i.e. chorea, dystonia, and spasticity). affected people may also experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), impaired vision, seizures and an inability to communicate. children with this condition often pass away prior to age 10 years, although survival beyond age 20 years has been reported. pch2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the tsen54, tsen2, tsen34, or sepsecs gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."
what causes childhood extracranial germ cell tumors ?,the cause of most childhood extracranial germ cell tumors is unknown.
what is (are) laron syndrome ?,"laron syndrome is a rare form of short stature that results from the body's inability to use growth hormone, a substance produced by the brain's pituitary gland that helps promote growth. affected individuals are close to normal size at birth, but they experience slow growth from early childhood that results in very short stature. if the condition is not treated, adult males typically reach a maximum height of about 4.5 feet; adult females may be just over 4 feet tall.  other features of untreated laron syndrome include reduced muscle strength and endurance, low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) in infancy, small genitals and delayed puberty, hair that is thin and fragile, and dental abnormalities. many affected individuals have a distinctive facial appearance, including a protruding forehead, a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose), and a blue tint to the whites of the eyes (blue sclerae). affected individuals have short limbs compared to the size of their torso, as well as small hands and feet. adults with this condition tend to develop obesity. however, the signs and symptoms of laron syndrome vary, even among affected members of the same family.  studies suggest that people with laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes. affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes). however, people with laron syndrome do not seem to have an increased lifespan compared with their unaffected relatives."
what is (are) trisomy 2 mosaicism ?,"trisomy 2 mosaicism is a rare chromosome condition caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 2 in a subset of a persons cells. many cases of trisomy 2 mosaicism result in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage during pregnancy. in live born infants, signs and symptoms vary widely but generally include poor growth of the baby while in the womb and multiple birth defects.  trisomy 2 mosaicism may be encountered during pregnancy as a finding following chorionic villus sampling. in these situations the trisomic cells are most often confined to the placenta and the pregnancy results in a healthy infant. further investigation is warranted however, because in a small percentage of cases this finding is associated with an increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction  and oligohydramnios. questions regarding trisomy 2 mosaicism should be discussed with a genetic professional. click here to visit genetests to search for a genetics professional near you."
what is (are) epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy ?,"epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy is a condition where the epithelium of the cornea (the outermost region of the cornea) loses its normal clarity due to a buildup of cloudy material. it gets its name from the unusual appearance of the cornea during an eye exam. this dystrophy occurs when the epithelium's basement membrane develops abnormally, causing the epithelial cells to not properly adhere to it. this leads to recurrent epithelial erosions, which can cause blurred vision and severe pain. this condition is usually not inherited. however, families with autosomal dominant inheritance and mutations in the tgfbi gene have been identified."
how to diagnose nephrotic syndrome in adults ?,"urine samples are taken to diagnose people suspected of having nephrotic syndrome.
                
nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when large amounts of protein are found in the urine. the blood protein albumin makes up much of the protein that is lost, though many other important proteins are also lost in nephrotic syndrome.
                
the presence of albumin in the urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. for the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. patches on the dipstick change color when protein is present in urine.
                
a more precise measurement is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. either a single urine sample or a 24-hour collection of urine can be sent to a lab for analysis. with the single urine sample, the lab measures both albumin and creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. the comparison of the measurements is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. a urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine may signal a problem. with a 24-hour collection of urine, the lab measures only the amount of albumin present. the single urine sample is easier to collect than the 24-hour sample and is usually sufficient to confirm diagnosis, though the 24-hour collection may be used in some cases.
                
once nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed, blood tests are usually needed to check for systemic diseases that may be causing the nephrotic syndrome and to find out how well the kidneys are working overall. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.
                
though blood tests can point toward systemic diseases, a kidney biopsy is usually needed to diagnose the specific underlying disease causing the nephrotic syndrome and to determine the best treatment. a kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. kidney biopsies are performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. a biopsy is often not needed for a person with diabetes because the persons medical history and lab tests may be enough to diagnose the problem as being a result of diabetes."
is ibids syndrome inherited ?,"what causes tay syndrome? how is it inherited? although tay syndrome is known to be genetic, the gene(s) associated with the condition is(are) unknown. tay syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern , which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered (mutated). if both parents carry the gene for tay syndrome, their children have a 25% chance of being affected with tay syndrome. additionally, each child has a 50% chance of being an unaffected carrier, like their parents, and a 25% chance of being a non-carrier."
what is the outlook for rett syndrome ?,"the course of rett syndrome, including the age of onset and the severity of symptoms, varies from child to child. despite the difficulties with symptoms, most individuals with rett syndrome continue to live well into middle age and beyond. because the disorder is rare, very little is known about long-term prognosis and life expectancy."
what is (are) patulous eustachian tube ?,"patulous eustachian tube is a benign condition in which the eustachian tube stays open most of the time. the eustachian tube is the tube that runs between the middle ear and throat and regulates the ear pressure around the ear drum. under normal circumstances, it remains closed most of the time, opening only on occasion to equalize air pressure between the middle ear and the exterior environment. major symptoms include distorted autophony (hearing one's own voice or breathing), echoing which may interfere with speech production, wave-like sounds, and a sensation of fullness in the ear. in severe cases, vertigo and hearing loss may occur. over time, individuals with patulous eustachian tube may develop serious and even extreme responses to the abnormal sounds and other findings. in most cases, the cause of patulous eustachian tube is unknown. weight loss and pregnancy may be predisposing factors. neurologic disorders that cause muscle atrophy such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease have been implicated in some cases of patulous eustachian tube. other cases may be associated with medications such as oral contraceptives or diuretics. other predisposing factors include fatigue, stress, anxiety, exercise, and temporomandibular joint syndrome."
what is (are) alzheimer's disease ?,"dementia is a loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning skills that interferes with a persons daily life and activities. alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia among older people. dementia ranges in severity from the mild stage, when it is just beginning to affect a persons functioning, to the severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for care."
what are the symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum type 7 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum type 7? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for xeroderma pigmentosum type 7. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) ataxia 5% cataract 5% growth delay 5% microcephaly 5% microphthalmia 5% pes cavus 5% spasticity 5% tremor 5% autosomal recessive inheritance - cutaneous photosensitivity - defective dna repair after ultraviolet radiation damage - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
"what are the genetic changes related to immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, x-linked syndrome ?","mutations in the foxp3 gene cause some cases of ipex syndrome. the protein produced from this gene is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and helps control the activity of particular genes. this protein is essential for the production and normal function of certain immune cells called regulatory t cells. regulatory t cells play an important role in controlling the immune system and preventing autoimmune disorders. mutations in the foxp3 gene lead to reduced numbers or a complete absence of regulatory t cells. without the proper number of regulatory t cells, the body cannot control immune responses. normal body tissues and organs are attacked, causing the multiple autoimmune disorders present in people with ipex syndrome.  about half of individuals diagnosed with ipex syndrome do not have identified mutations in the foxp3 gene. in these cases, the cause of the disorder is unknown."
what causes x-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita ?,"what causes x-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita? x-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is caused by mutations in the nr0b1 gene. the nr0b1 gene provides instructions to make a protein called dax1. this protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing tissues including the adrenal glands, two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). the hormones produced by these glands control many important body functions. some nr0b1 mutations result in the production of an inactive version of the dax1 protein, while other mutations delete the entire gene. the resulting shortage of dax1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occur when endocrine glands do not produce the right amounts of certain hormones."
is wildervanck syndrome inherited ?,"how is wildervanck syndrome inherited? wildervanck syndrome does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.  in most cases, only one person in a family is affected.  these cases are called isolated or sporadic because there is no family history of wildervanck syndrome.  because this syndrome occurs mostly in females, it is possible that this condition has x-linked dominant inheritance.  the lack of males with wildervanck syndrome suggests that affected males have more severe features and do not survive to birth."
what is (are) hematuria (blood in the urine) ?,"the urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. the urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra water. the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. when the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder."
what are the symptoms of multiple myeloma ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma? in some cases, multiple myeloma is not associated with any signs and symptoms. when present, the most common symptom is anemia (low red blood cell count), which can be associated with fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. other features of the condition may include: bone pain nausea constipation loss of appetite frequent infections weight loss excessive thirst weakness and/or numbness in the arms and legs confusion abnormal bleeding weak bones that may break easily difficulty breathing the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for multiple myeloma. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - autosomal recessive inheritance - multiple myeloma - somatic mutation - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

what are the genetic changes related to mycosis fungoides ?,"the cause of mycosis fungoides is unknown. most affected individuals have one or more chromosomal abnormalities, such as the loss or gain of genetic material. these abnormalities occur during a person's lifetime and are found only in the dna of cancerous cells. abnormalities have been found on most chromosomes, but some regions are more commonly affected than others. people with this condition tend to have additions of dna in regions of chromosomes 7 and 17 or loss of dna from regions of chromosomes 9 and 10. it is unclear whether these genetic changes play a role in mycosis fungoides, although the tendency to acquire chromosome abnormalities (chromosomal instability) is a feature of many cancers. it can lead to genetic changes that allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.  other research suggests that certain variants of hla class ii genes are associated with mycosis fungoides. hla genes help the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). each hla gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. the specific variants are inherited through families. certain variations of hla genes may affect the risk of developing mycosis fungoides or may impact progression of the disorder.  it is possible that other factors, such as environmental exposure or certain bacterial or viral infections, are involved in the development of mycosis fungoides. however, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of this complex disorder remains unclear."
what are the genetic changes related to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ?,"mutations in the fas gene cause alps in approximately 75 percent of affected individuals. the fas gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in cell signaling that results in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).  when the immune system is turned on (activated) to fight an infection, large numbers of lymphocytes are produced. normally, these lymphocytes undergo apoptosis when they are no longer required. fas gene mutations result in an abnormal protein that interferes with apoptosis. excess lymphocytes accumulate in the body's tissues and organs and often begin attacking them, leading to autoimmune disorders. interference with apoptosis allows cells to multiply without control, leading to the lymphomas and other cancers that occur in people with this disorder.  alps may also be caused by mutations in additional genes, some of which have not been identified."
what are the symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency? the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex ii deficiency can vary greatly from severe life-threatening symptoms in infancy to muscle disease beginning in adulthood. many factors affect symptom and symptom severity, including what gene mutation is involved. many genes must work together to ensure that the enzyme, complex ii (succinate dehydrogenase), can perform its job normally in the body. changes in the sdha, sdhb, sdhc, sdhd, sdhaf1, or sdhaf2 genes can all potentially cause complex ii deficiency. much of what we know today about the signs and symptoms of complex ii deficiency are based on articles which describe individual patients. due to the rarity of this condition and the complexity of its cause, it is very difficult to predict how a person will be affected. we strongly recommend that you work with your or your childs healthcare provider to learn more about how the deficiency is affecting your or your childs health. in the meantime, we have summarized symptoms of complex ii deficiency which have been described in case reports: inheriting two sdha gene mutations has caused myoclonic seizures and leighs syndrome. leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that typically arises in the first year of life. this condition is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within a couple of years, usually due to respiratory failure. a small number of people develop symptoms in adulthood or have symptoms that worsen more slowly. the first signs of leigh syndrome seen in infancy are usually vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) that leads to eating problems. click here to visit genetics home reference and learn more about leigh syndrome. inheriting two sdhb gene mutations can cause leukodystrophy. leukodystrophies affect the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. this leads to problems with movement, speaking, vision, hearing, and mental and physical development. most of the leukodystrophies appear during infancy or childhood. they can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. however, symptoms gradually get worse over time.  click here to visit medlineplus.gov and learn more about leukodystprohy. inheriting two sdhaf1 gene mutations can cause severe progressive leukoencephalopathy beginning in infancy. leukoencephalopathy refers to the degeneration of the white matter of the brain.  it is usually diagnosed by mri. it causes cognitive impairment, increased muscle tone, and hyperactive reflexes. inheriting two sdhd gene mutations can cause progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor retardation), and seizures. signs and symptoms may begin in infancy and progress through childhood. complex ii deficiency has also been described in association with dilated cardiomyopathy (and heart failure in childhood), hemolytic uremic syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, congenital dislocation of the hip joint, progressive encephalomyopathy (a disorder affecting the brain and skeletal muscle, usually causing weakness) with dementia, and kearnssayre syndrome. case reports have also demonstrated that people who have only a single mutation in one of these genes may also be at risk for health problems: having one sdha gene mutation caused optic atrophy, ataxia, proximal myopathy in adulthood. having one mutation in the sdha, sdhb, sdhc, sdhaf2, or sdhd gene can cause an increased risk for paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mitochondrial complex ii deficiency. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal mitochondria in muscle tissue -

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for dementia ?,the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct research related to dementia in laboratories at the nih and also support additional dementia research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. current research focuses on many different aspects of dementia. this research promises to improve the lives of people affected by the dementias and may eventually lead to ways of preventing or curing these disorders.
what is the outlook for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:         - how quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment.    - age at the time of diagnosis, gender, race, and ethnic background.    - the number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis.    - whether the leukemia cells began from b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes.    - whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer.    - whether the child has down syndrome.    - whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid.    - the child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment.        treatment options depend on:         - whether the leukemia cells began from b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes.    - whether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very highrisk all.    - the age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as the philadelphia chromosome.    - whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy.    - how quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment.        for leukemia that relapses (comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:         - how long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back.    - whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body."

what is (are) orofaciodigital syndrome 1 ?,"orofaciodigital syndrome 1 (ofd1), also called orofaciodigital syndrome type 1, is a condition that affects the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes). this condition also causes polycystic kidney disease. orofaciodigital syndrome 1 is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene called ofd1 which appears to play an important role in the early development of many parts of the body including the brain, face, limbs, and kidneys. the syndrome is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the diagnosis of ofd1 is sometimes made at birth, but it may be suspected only after polycystic kidney disease is found in later childhood or adulthood. treatment for ofd1 typically focuses on the symptoms an individual has and may include surgery for cleft lip or palate , other oral abnormalities, or syndactyly (webbing of the fingers or toes). researchers have identified at least 13 potential forms of orofaciodigital syndromes, which are classified by their patterns of signs and symptoms. ofd1 is the most common form of orofaciodigital syndrome and differs from the other types mainly by its association with polycystic kidney disease."
how to diagnose fecal incontinence ?,"health care providers diagnose fecal incontinence based on a persons medical history, physical exam, and medical test results. in addition to a general medical history, the health care provider may ask the following questions:
                
- when did fecal incontinence start?  - how often does fecal incontinence occur?  - how much stool leaks? does the stool just streak the underwear? does just a little bit of solid or liquid stool leak out or does complete loss of bowel control occur?  - does fecal incontinence involve a strong urge to have a bowel movement or does it happen without warning?  - for people with hemorrhoids, do hemorrhoids bulge through the anus? do the hemorrhoids pull back in by themselves, or do they have to be pushed in with a finger?  - how does fecal incontinence affect daily life?  - is fecal incontinence worse after eating? do certain foods seem to make fecal incontinence worse?  - can passing gas be controlled?
                
people may want to keep a stool diary for several weeks before their appointment so they can answer these questions. a stool diary is a chart for recording daily bowel movement details. a sample stool diary is available on the bowel control awareness campaign website at www.bowelcontrol.nih.gov.
                
the person may be referred to a doctor who specializes in problems of the digestive system, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist, or colorectal surgeon, or a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as a urologist or urogynecologist. the specialist will perform a physical exam and may suggest one or more of the following tests:
                
- anal manometry  - anal ultrasound  - magnetic resonance imaging (mri)  - defecography  - flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy  - anal electromyography (emg)
                
anal manometry. anal manometry uses pressure sensors and a balloon that can be inflated in the rectum to check the sensitivity and function of the rectum. anal manometry also checks the tightness of the anal sphincter muscles around the anus. to prepare for this test, the person should use an enema and not eat anything 2 hours before the test. an enema involves flushing water or a laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle. a laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. for this test, a thin tube with a balloon on its tip and pressure sensors below the balloon is inserted into the anus until the balloon is in the rectum and pressure sensors are located in the anal canal. the tube is slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. no anesthesia is needed for this test, which takes about 30 minutes.
                
anal ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. an anal ultrasound is specific to the anus and rectum. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. anesthesia is not needed. the images can show the structure of the anal sphincter muscles.
                
mri. mri machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confined spaces may be given medication to help them relax. an mri may include the injection of special dye, called contrast medium. with most mri machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. mris can show problems with the anal sphincter muscles. mri is an alternative to anal ultrasound that may provide more detailed information, especially about the external anal sphincter.
                
defecography. this x ray of the area around the anus and rectum shows how well the person can hold and evacuate stool. the test also identifies structural changes in the rectum and anus such as rectocele and rectal prolapse. to prepare for the test, the person uses two enemas and does not eat anything 2 hours prior to the test. during the test, the health care provider fills the rectum with a soft paste that shows up on x rays and is the same consistency as stool. the person sits on a toilet inside an x-ray machine. the person is first asked to pull in and squeeze the sphincter muscles to prevent leakage and then to strain as if having a bowel movement. the radiologist studies the x rays to identify problems with the rectum, anus, and pelvic floor muscles.
                
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. these tests are used to help diagnose problems causing fecal incontinence. the tests are similar, but colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. these tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. for both tests, a health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. the person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test. a laxative may be required the night before the test. one or more enemas may be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.
                
in most cases, people will be given light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, to help them relax during flexible sigmoidoscopy. anesthesia is used for colonoscopy. for either test, the person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. a small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. the test can show problems in the lower gi tract that may be causing the bowel control problem. the gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue from the bowel lining for examination with a microscope.
                
the person will not feel the biopsy. a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab to confirm the diagnosis.
                
cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. driving is not permitted for 24 hours after flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to allow the anesthesia time to wear off. before the appointment, a person should make plans for a ride home. full recovery is expected by the next day and the person is able to go back to a normal diet.
                
anal emg. anal emg checks the health of the pelvic floor muscles and the nerves that control the muscles. the health care provider inserts a very thin needle electrode through the skin into the muscle. the electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by the muscles and shows it as images on a monitor or sounds through a speaker. an alternative type of anal emg uses stainless steel plates attached to the sides of a plastic plug instead of a needle. the plug is inserted into the anal canal to measure the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter and other pelvic floor muscles. the average amount of electrical activity when the person relaxes quietly, squeezes to prevent a bowel movement, and strains to have a bowel movement shows whether there is damage to the nerves that control the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles."
what is (are) lung cancer ?,"lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. lung cancer may or may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, blood in the mucus, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.  lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.  small cell lung cancer grows quickly and often spreads to other tissues (metastasizes), most commonly to the adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney), liver, brain, and bones. in more than half of cases, the small cell lung cancer has spread beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. after diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about one year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.  non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. squamous cell carcinoma arises from the squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi). large cell carcinoma describes non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. as the name suggests, the tumor cells are large when viewed under a microscope. the 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for multifocal motor neuropathy ?,"the ninds supports a broad range of research on neuromuscular disorders with the goal of finding ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them."
what is (are) spastic paraplegia 11 ?,"spastic paraplegia 11 is a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. people with spastic paraplegia 11 experience progressive muscle stiffness and eventual paralysis of the lower limbs, as well as a range of other neurologic symptoms. the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is abnormally thin in individuals with this condition. spastic paraplegia 11 is caused by mutations in the spg11 gene and is passed through families in an autosomal recessive fashion."
what is (are) insulin resistance and prediabetes ?,"insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. the pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.
                
insulin plays a major role in metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. the digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose. glucose is a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. with the help of insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy.
                
insulin's role in blood glucose control
                
when blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin and glucose then travel in the blood to cells throughout the body.
                
- insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. the stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.
                
in a healthy person, these functions allow blood glucose and insulin levels to remain in the normal range."
what are the symptoms of spastic paraplegia 4 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia 4? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for spastic paraplegia 4. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) aggressive behavior - agitation - apathy - autosomal dominant inheritance - babinski sign - degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tracts - dementia - depression - disinhibition - genetic anticipation - hyperreflexia - impaired vibration sensation in the lower limbs - insidious onset - intellectual disability - low back pain - lower limb muscle weakness - memory impairment - nystagmus - paraplegia - progressive - spastic gait - spastic paraplegia - urinary bladder sphincter dysfunction - urinary incontinence - urinary urgency - variable expressivity - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
how many people are affected by spastic paraplegia type 7 ?,"the prevalence of all hereditary spastic paraplegias combined is estimated to be 2 to 6 in 100,000 people worldwide. spastic paraplegia type 7 likely accounts for only a small percentage of all spastic paraplegia cases."
what is (are) breast cancer ?,breast cancer occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the breast tissue. the cancer can be found in the breast itself or in the ducts and lymph nodes that surround the breast.
what are the genetic changes related to ring chromosome 20 syndrome ?,"ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). a ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  it is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. in some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. however, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. in these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome."
how to diagnose thalassemia ?,"is genetic testing available for thalassemia? yes, genetic testing is available for hbb, hba1 and hba2, the genes known to cause thalassemia. carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known. the genetic testing registry (gtr) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. it has additional information on genetic testing for alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."

how can y. enterocolitica infections be diagnosed for yersinia ?,"y. enterocolitica infections are generally diagnosed by detecting the organism in the stools. many laboratories do not routinely test for y. enterocolitica,so it is important to notify laboratory personnel when infection with this bacterium is suspected so that special tests can be done. the organism can also be recovered from other sites, including the throat, lymph nodes, joint fluid, urine, bile, and blood."
what is (are) childhood brain tumors ?,"brain tumors are abnormal growths inside the skull. they are among the most common types of childhood cancers. some are benign tumors, which aren't cancer. they can still be serious. malignant tumors are cancerous.    childhood brain and spinal cord tumors can cause headaches and other symptoms. however, other conditions can also cause the same symptoms. check with a doctor if your child has any of the following problems:       - morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    - frequent nausea and vomiting    - vision, hearing, and speech problems    - loss of balance or trouble walking    - unusual sleepiness    - personality changes    - seizures    - increased head size in infants       the symptoms are not the same in every child.    doctors use physical and neurological exams, lab tests, and imaging to diagnose brain tumors. most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery.    treatment for children is sometimes different than for an adult. long-term side effects are an important issue. the options also depend on the type of tumor and where it is. removal of the tumor is often possible. if not, radiation, chemotherapy, or both may be used.    nih: national cancer institute"

what are the genetic changes related to cherubism ?,"mutations in the sh3bp2 gene have been identified in about 80 percent of people with cherubism. in most of the remaining cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown.  the sh3bp2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unclear. the protein plays a role in transmitting chemical signals within cells, particularly cells involved in the replacement of old bone tissue with new bone (bone remodeling) and certain immune system cells.  mutations in the sh3bp2 gene lead to the production of an overly active version of this protein. the effects of sh3bp2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. the overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. an excess of these bone-eating cells contributes to the destruction of bone in the upper and lower jaws. a combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of cherubism."
what is (are) dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 ?,"dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is a rare and severe form of dentinogenesis imperfecta, a condition that affects tooth development. people affected by the condition may have weak and discolored teeth. these problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. people with this form of dentinogenesis imperfecta have no normal teeth. sensorineural hearing loss has also been found in some affected people. dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the dspp gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. treatment is usually focused on protecting primary (baby) and then permanent teeth with preformed pediatric crowns and other interventions. the replacement of teeth might be considered in the future with dentures and/or implants."
what are the treatments for buschke ollendorff syndrome ?,"how might buschke ollendorff syndrome be treated? there is currently no cure for bos. surgical removal of lesions on or under the skin may be done for cosmetic purposes. in some patients, surgical treatment of deafness may be possible. surgery might also be necessary for some of the signs or symptoms associated with bos. osteopoikilosis is typically asymptomatic, but about 15-20% of individuals experience pain and joint effusions (fluid build-up). usually, no special restrictions in activity are required for individuals with bos.[3150]"
what are the treatments for cardiogenic shock ?,"cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment. the condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. if the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive.
                
the first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs.
                
sometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. for example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment.
                
emergency life support
                
emergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. this treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs.
                
restoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. emergency life support treatment includes:
                
giving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body.
                
providing breathing support if needed. a ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.
                
giving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). this can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. this treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.
                
medicines
                
during and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. if the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.
                
treatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. doctors may prescribe medicines to:
                
prevent blood clots from forming
                
increase the force with which the heart muscle contracts
                
treat a heart attack
                
medical devices
                
medical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include:
                
an intra-aortic balloon pump. this device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. a balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. this allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys.
                
a left ventricular assist device (lvad). this device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. an lvad helps the heart pump blood to the body. this device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock.
                
medical procedures and surgery
                
sometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock.
                
medical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock.
                
surgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival.
                
the types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include:
                
percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) and stents. pci,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. a stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during pci to help keep it open.
                
coronary artery bypass grafting. for this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. this creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart.
                
surgery to repair damaged heart valves.
                
surgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. this break is called a septal rupture.
                
heart transplant. this type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival."
what is (are) prostate cancer ?,"prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. in this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. the prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm.  early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (psa) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. as the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. however, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer.  the severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. in other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening.  some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. the signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. if prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips.  a small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. these hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases."
what is (are) mnire's disease ?,"mnire's disease is an abnormality of the inner ear. signs and symptoms may include disabling vertigo or severe dizziness lasting from minutes to hours; tinnitus or a roaring sound in the ears; fluctuating hearing loss; and the sensation of pressure or pain in the affected ear. a small percentage of people have drop attacks, also called spells of tumarkin. the disorder usually affects only one ear and is a common cause of hearing loss. some people develop symptoms in both ears many years after their initial diagnosis. the exact cause of mnire's disease is unknown, but the symptoms are thought to be associated with a change in fluid volume within a portion of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. treatment may include medications or surgery depending on the severity of the condition."
what are the treatments for hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis ?,"how might hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - dutch type be treated? there is no known effective treatment for hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - dutch type. treatment is supportive and based on the control of symptoms. in some cases, rehabilitation is needed for weakness or clumsiness. this can include physical, occupational, or speech therapy. occasionally, some patients are good candidates for medications that can help improve memory. the management of intracranial hemorrhage (ich) related to hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - dutch type is identical to the standard management of ich. the main objectives include reversing anticoagulation, managing intracranial pressure, and preventing complications."
what is (are) sweat ?,"sweat is a clear, salty liquid produced by glands in your skin. sweating is how your body cools itself. you sweat mainly under your arms and on your feet and palms. when sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin, it can cause a smell. bathing regularly and using antiperspirants or deodorants can help control the odor.     sweating a lot is normal when it is hot or when you exercise, are anxious, or have a fever. it also happens during menopause. if you often sweat too much, it's called hyperhidrosis. causes include thyroid or nervous system disorders, low blood sugar, or another health problem.     sweating too little, anhidrosis, can be life-threatening because your body can overheat. causes of anhidrosis include dehydration, burns, and some skin and nerve disorders."
what is (are) gigantomastia ?,"gigantomastia is a rare condition that is characterized by excessive breast growth that may occur spontaneously, during puberty or pregnancy, or while taking certain medications. to date, there is no universally accepted definition for gigantomastia; however, dancey et al. (2007) state that a review of the medical literature suggests that definitions range from a d-cup bra size to breast enlargement requiring reduction of over 0.8 - 2 kg, which is equivalent to about 1.75 - 4.5 pounds. the exact cause of gigantomastia has not been determined. nonetheless, the following theories have been proposed to explain gigantomastia: (1) end-organ hypersensitivity (a condition in which the breast tissue is more sensitive to hormones circulating in the body), (2) autoimmune issues, (3) high igf-1 (insulin growth factor-1, a hormone involved in regulating bone growth) and (4) hyperprolactanemia (high levels of prolactin). gigantomastia has been noted as a side effect of treatment with certain medications like d-pencillamine and in one case as an apparently hereditary condition. symptoms of gigantomastic may include mastalgia (breast pain), ulceration/infection, posture problems, back pain and chronic traction injury to 4th/5th/6th intercostal nerves with resultant loss of nipple sensation. it is may also associated with decreased fetal growth, if the gigantomastia is present during pregnancy. treatment is based on the person's symptoms and may include breast reduction, mastectomy with or without reconstruction, hormonal treatment, or a combination of treatments."

                    - breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.    -  a family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer.    - breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes).     -  the use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer.    - signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.    - tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.    - if cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.
                    the breast is made up of lobes and ducts. each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes. each lobe has many smaller sections called lobules. lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can make milk. the lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts.      each breast also has blood vessels and lymph vessels. the lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. lymph vessels carry lymph between lymph nodes. lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that are found throughout the body. they filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest.   the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. cancer that begins in the lobes or lobules is called lobular carcinoma and is more often found in both breasts than are other types of breast cancer. inflammatory breast cancer is an uncommon type of breast cancer in which the breast is warm, red, and swollen.    see the following pdq summaries for more information about breast cancer:         -  breast cancer prevention     -  breast cancer screening     -  breast cancer treatment and pregnancy     -  male breast cancer treatment     -  unusual cancers of childhood treatment (for information about breast cancer in childhood)"

is collagen vi-related myopathy inherited ?,"collagen vi-related myopathy can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. bethlem myopathy is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, as are some cases of the intermediate form and a few rare instances of ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  collagen vi-related myopathy can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, as are some cases of the intermediate form and a few rare instances of bethlem myopathy. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome ?,"craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome is caused by mutations in the pax3 gene. the pax3 gene plays a critical role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. to perform this function, the gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific areas of dna to help control the activity of particular genes. during embryonic development, the pax3 gene is active in cells called neural crest cells. these cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo. the protein produced from the pax3 gene directs the activity of other genes that signal neural crest cells to form specialized tissues or cell types. these include some nerve tissues, bones in the face and skull (craniofacial bones), and muscle tissue.  at least one pax3 gene mutation has been identified in individuals with craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome. this mutation appears to affect the ability of the pax3 protein to bind to dna. as a result, the pax3 protein cannot control the activity of other genes and cannot regulate the differentiation of neural crest cells. a lack of specialization of neural crest cells leads to the impaired growth of craniofacial bones, nerve tissue, and muscles seen in craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome."
what is (are) sneddon syndrome ?,"sneddon syndrome is a progressive condition characterized by livedo reticularis (bluish net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin) and neurological abnormalities. symptoms may include headache, dizziness, high blood pressure, heart disease, mini-strokes and/or stroke. reduced blood flow to the brain may cause lesions to develop within the central nervous system. this can lead to reduced mental capacity, memory loss and other neurological symptoms. the exact cause of sneddon syndrome is unknown. some familial cases have been described. it has also been associated with obliterating vasculitis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."
how many people are affected by ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome ?,the prevalence of ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome is not known; approximately 35 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
what are the genetic changes related to pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ?,"mutations in the plp1 gene cause pelizaeus-merzbacher disease. the plp1 gene provides instructions for producing proteolipid protein 1 and a modified version (isoform) of proteolipid protein 1, called dm20. proteolipid protein 1 and dm20 are primarily located in the central nervous system and are the main proteins found in myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers. a lack of proteolipid protein 1 and dm20 can cause dysmyelination, which can impair nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of pelizaeus-merzbacher disease.  it is estimated that 5 percent to 20 percent of people with pelizaeus-merzbacher disease do not have identified mutations in the plp1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."
is acral peeling skin syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with breast cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery     most patients with breast cancer have surgery to remove the cancer.     sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. it is the first lymph node where the cancer is likely to spread. a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. after the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the tumor using breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. if cancer cells were not found in the sentinel lymph node, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. if cancer cells were found, more lymph nodes will be removed through a separate incision. this is called a lymph node dissection.    types of surgery include the following:            - breast-conserving surgery is an operation to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. this type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.     -  total mastectomy: surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer. this procedure is also called a simple mastectomy. some of the lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked for cancer. this may be done at the same time as the breast surgery or after. this is done through a separate incision.      -  modified radical mastectomy: surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles.             chemotherapy may be given before surgery to remove the tumor. when given before surgery, chemotherapy will shrink the tumor and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. treatment given before surgery is called preoperative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy.    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after surgery, to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called postoperative therapy or adjuvant therapy.     if a patient is going to have a mastectomy, breast reconstruction (surgery to rebuild a breasts shape after a mastectomy) may be considered. breast reconstruction may be done at the time of the mastectomy or at some time after. the reconstructed breast may be made with the patients own (nonbreast) tissue or by using implants filled with saline or silicone gel. before the decision to get an implant is made, patients can call the food and drug administration's (fda) center for devices and radiologic health at 1-888-info-fda (1-888-463-6332) or visit the fda website for more information on breast implants.        radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat breast cancer. internal radiation therapy with strontium-89 (a radionuclide) is used to relieve bone pain caused by breast cancer that has spread to the bones. strontium-89 is injected into a vein and travels to the surface of the bones. radiation is released and kills cancer cells in the bones.       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. systemic chemotherapy is used in the treatment of breast cancer.    see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.       hormone therapy      hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. the hormone estrogen, which makes some breast cancers grow, is made mainly by the ovaries. treatment to stop the ovaries from making estrogen is called ovarian ablation.     hormone therapy with tamoxifen is often given to patients with early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery and those with metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). hormone therapy with tamoxifen or estrogens can act on cells all over the body and may increase the chance of developing endometrial cancer. women taking tamoxifen should have a pelvic exam every year to look for any signs of cancer. any vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual bleeding, should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible.    hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) agonist is given to some premenopausal women who have just been diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. lhrh agonists decrease the body's estrogen and progesterone.     hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is given to some postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer. aromatase inhibitors decrease the body's estrogen by blocking an enzyme called aromatase from turning androgen into estrogen. anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are types of aromatase inhibitors.    for the treatment of early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery, certain aromatase inhibitors may be used as adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen use. for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials to compare them to hormone therapy with tamoxifen.    other types of hormone therapy include megestrol acetate or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant.    see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitors, and parp inhibitors are types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of breast cancer.    monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. monoclonal antibodies may be used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.    types of monoclonal antibody therapy include the following:            -  trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein her2, which sends growth signals to breast cancer cells. it may be used with other therapies to treat her2 positive breast cancer.      -  pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat breast cancer. it may be used to treat certain patients with her2 positive breast cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). it may also be used as neoadjuvant therapy in certain patients with early stage her2 positive breast cancer.     -  ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody linked to an anticancer drug. this is called an antibody-drug conjugate. it is used to treat her2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or recurred (come back).            tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy. tyrosine kinase inhibitors include the following:            -  lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the effects of the her2 protein and other proteins inside tumor cells. it may be used with other drugs to treat patients with her2 positive breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with trastuzumab.           cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which cause the growth of cancer cells. cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors include the following:            -  palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used with the drug letrozole to treat breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and her2 negative and has spread to other parts of the body. it is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy. palbociclib may also be used with fulvestrant in women whose disease has gotten worse after treatment with hormone therapy.      -  ribociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used with letrozole to treat breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive and her2 negative and has come back or spread to other parts of the body. it is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy.            mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitors block a protein called mtor, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. mtor inhibitors include the following:            -  everolimus is an mtor inhibitor used in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer that is also her2 negative and has not gotten better with other treatment.            parp inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block dna repair and may cause cancer cells to die. parp inhibitor therapy is being studied for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer or tumors with  brca1  or  brca2  mutations.    see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.    studies have shown that high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not work better than standard chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer. doctors have decided that, for now, high-dose chemotherapy should be tested only in clinical trials. before taking part in such a trial, women should talk with their doctors about the serious side effects, including death, that may be caused by high-dose chemotherapy.
                
                
                    treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.
                    for information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our side effects page.   some treatments for breast cancer may cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended. these are called late effects.   late effects of radiation therapy are not common, but may include:         -  inflammation of the lung after radiation therapy to the breast, especially when chemotherapy is given at the same time.     - arm lymphedema, especially when radiation therapy is given after lymph node dissection.     - in women younger than 45 years who receive radiation therapy to the chest wall after mastectomy, there may be a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.        late effects of chemotherapy depend on the drugs used, but may include:         -  heart failure.    -  blood clots.    -  premature menopause.    -  second cancer, such as leukemia.        late effects of targeted therapy with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab may include:         - heart problems such as heart failure.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what are the treatments for problems with smell ?,"depending on the cause of your smell disorder, your doctor may be able to treat your problem or suggest ways to cope with it. if a certain medication is the cause of the disorder, ask your doctor if you could substitute other medications or reduce the dose. your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. some patients with respiratory infections or allergies regain their sense of smell when the illness or condition is over. often, correcting a general medical problem also can restore the sense of smell. for patients with nasal obstructions, such as polyps, or other inflammatory conditions of the nose or sinuses, medical treatments or surgery can restore the sense of smell. occasionally, the sense of smell returns to normal on its own, without any treatment. your doctor may suggest oral steroid medications such as prednisone, which is usually used for a short period of time, or topical steroid sprays, which can be used for longer periods of time. antibiotics are also used to treat nasal infections. the effectiveness of both steroids and antibiotics depends greatly on the severity and duration of the nasal swelling or infection. often relief is temporary."
what is the outlook for urethral cancer ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - where the cancer formed in the urethra.    - whether the cancer has spread through the mucosa lining the urethra to nearby tissue, to lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.    - whether the patient is a male or female.    - the patient's general health.    - whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)."

is stickler syndrome inherited ?,"stickler syndrome types i, ii, and iii are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations. these cases occur in people with no history of stickler syndrome in their family.  marshall syndrome also typically has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.  stickler syndrome types iv, v, and vi are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by atelosteogenesis type 1 ?,atelosteogenesis type 1 is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown. only a few dozen affected individuals have been identified.
is meningoencephalocele inherited ?,"is meningoencephalocele inherited? meningoencephalocele is not thought to be an inherited condition. studies have proposed that meningoencephalocele is likely a multifactorial defect. this means that both environmental factors and multiple genes may interact with each other to cause the condition. studies have suggested that environmental factors probably play an important role. this information is supported by the fact that several studies have not identified the condition among close relatives of affected individuals. to date, there have been no genes identified that are likely to play a strong part in causing the condition."
what are the treatments for stargardt disease ?,"how might stargardt disease be treated? at present there is no cure for stargardt disease, and there is very little that can be done to slow its progression. wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from uva, uvb and bright light may be of some benefit. animal studies have shown that taking excessive amounts of vitamin a and beta carotene could promote the additional accumulation of lipofuscin, as well as a toxic vitamin a derivative called a2e; it is typically recommended that these be avoided by individuals with stargardt disease. there are possible treatments for stargardt disease that are being tested, including a gene therapy treatment, which has been given orphan drug status by the european medicines agency (emea, similar to the fda). you can read more about this treatment by clicking here. there are also clinical trials involving embryonic stem cell treatments."
what is (are) pudendal neuralgia ?,"pudendal neuralgia occurs when the pudendal nerve is injured or compressed.  symptoms include pain, burning, tingling, or numbness in the pelvic or buttock areas; symptoms worsen while an affected individual is in a sitting position.  the cause of pudendal neuralgia is unknown.  treatment includes nerve block of the pudendal nerve or surgery to remove surrounding tissues that might be pressing on the nerve."
is rett syndrome inherited ?,"is rett syndrome inherited? although rett syndrome is a genetic disorder, less than 1 percent of recorded cases are inherited or passed from one generation to the next. most cases are sporadic, which means the mutation occurs randomly, and are not inherited. a few families have been described with more than one affected family member. these cases helped researchers determine that rett syndrome has an x-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to fish-eye disease ?,"fish-eye disease is caused by mutations in the lcat gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat).  the lcat enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues by helping it attach to molecules called lipoproteins, which carry it to the liver. once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. the enzyme has two major functions, called alpha- and beta-lcat activity. alpha-lcat activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high-density lipoprotein (hdl). beta-lcat activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low-density lipoprotein (vldl) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl).  lcat gene mutations that cause fish-eye disease impair alpha-lcat activity, reducing the enzyme's ability to attach cholesterol to hdl. impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol-containing opacities in the corneas. it is not known why the cholesterol deposits affect only the corneas in this disorder. mutations that affect both alpha-lcat activity and beta-lcat activity lead to a related disorder called complete lcat deficiency, which involves corneal opacities in combination with features affecting other parts of the body."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.    there are different types of immunotherapy:            -  immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:                  -  ctla-4 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when ctla-4 attaches to another protein called b7 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. ctla-4 inhibitors attach to ctla-4 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. ipilimumab is a type of ctla-4 inhibitor.       -  pd-1 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when pd-1 attaches to another protein called pdl-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. pd-1 inhibitors attach to pdl-1 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. nivolumab and pembrolizumab are pd-1 inhibitors.                -  vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.              targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do. there are different types of targeted therapy:            -  mtor inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive. sirolimus is a type of mtor inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. mk-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. the monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. the drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what are the genetic changes related to myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers ?,"mutations in the mt-tk gene are the most common cause of merrf, occurring in more than 80 percent of all cases. less frequently, mutations in the mt-tl1, mt-th, and mt-ts1 genes have been reported to cause the signs and symptoms of merrf. people with mutations in the mt-tl1, mt-th, or mt-ts1 gene typically have signs and symptoms of other mitochondrial disorders as well as those of merrf.  the mt-tk, mt-tl1, mt-th, and mt-ts1 genes are contained in mitochondrial dna (mtdna). mitochondria are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. although most dna is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own dna. the genes associated with merrf provide instructions for making molecules called transfer rnas, which are chemical cousins of dna. these molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length, functioning proteins within mitochondria. these proteins perform the steps of oxidative phosphorylation.  mutations that cause merrf impair the ability of mitochondria to make proteins, use oxygen, and produce energy. these mutations particularly affect organs and tissues with high energy requirements, such as the brain and muscles. researchers have not determined how changes in mtdna lead to the specific signs and symptoms of merrf.  a small percentage of merrf cases are caused by mutations in other mitochondrial genes, and in some cases the cause of the condition is unknown."
what is (are) congenital heart defects ?,"a congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. it is present at birth. congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. the defects can involve the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. they can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. the blood flow can slow down, go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place, or be blocked completely.    doctors use a physical exam and special heart tests to diagnose congenital heart defects. they often find severe defects during pregnancy or soon after birth. signs and symptoms of severe defects in newborns include       - rapid breathing    - cyanosis - a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails    - fatigue    - poor blood circulation       many congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. they are often not diagnosed until children are older.    many children with congenital heart defects don't need treatment, but others do. treatment can include medicines, catheter procedures, surgery, and heart transplants. the treatment depends on the type of the defect, how severe it is, and a child's age, size, and general health.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with plasma cell neoplasms.
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with plasma cell neoplasms. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    eight types of treatment are used:
                    chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    see drugs approved for multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms for more information.       other drug therapy     corticosteroids are steroids that have antitumor effects in multiple myeloma.        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. several types of targeted therapy may be used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors. bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, daratumumab, and elotuzumab are proteasome inhibitors used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks enzymes needed for cell division and may stop the growth of cancer cells. panobinostat is an hdac inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.    see drugs approved for multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms for more information.       high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    this treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous transplant) or a donor (allogeneic transplant) and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.           biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     immunomodulators are a type of biologic therapy. thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide are immunomodulators used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     interferon is a type of biologic therapy. it affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.     see drugs approved for multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms for more information.       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat plasma cell neoplasms.       surgery     surgery to remove the tumor may be done and is usually followed by radiation therapy. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       watchful waiting     watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     new combinations of therapies     clinical trials are studying different combinations of biologic therapy, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, and drugs. new treatment regimens using thalidomide or lenalidomide are also being studied.
                
                
                    supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.
                    this therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life. supportive care is given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     supportive care may include the following:          -  plasmapheresis: if the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and interferes with circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. in this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. the patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. the normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.     -  high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant: if amyloidosis occurs, treatment may include high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells.    -  biologic therapy: biologic therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  targeted therapy: targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  radiation therapy: radiation therapy is given for bone lesions of the spine.    -  chemotherapy: chemotherapy is given to reduce back pain from osteoporosis or compression fractures of the spine.    -  bisphosphonate therapy: bisphosphonate therapy is given to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain. see the following pdq summaries for more information on bisphosphonates and problems related to their use:               - cancer pain      - oral complications of chemotherapy and head/neck radiation

                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    survival for men with breast cancer is similar to that for women with breast cancer when their stage at diagnosis is the same. breast cancer in men, however, is often diagnosed at a later stage. cancer found at a later stage may be less likely to be cured.
                
                
                    certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                    the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - the stage of the cancer (whether it is in the breast only or has spread to other places in the body).    - the type of breast cancer.    - estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue.    - whether the cancer is also found in the other breast.    - the patients age and general health."
what are the genetic changes related to lowe syndrome ?,"mutations in the ocrl gene cause lowe syndrome. the ocrl gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps modify fat (lipid) molecules called membrane phospholipids. by controlling the levels of specific membrane phospholipids, the ocrl enzyme helps regulate the transport of certain substances to and from the cell membrane. this enzyme is also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that make up the cell's structural framework. the actin cytoskeleton has several critical functions, including determining cell shape and allowing cells to move.  some mutations in the ocrl gene prevent the production of any ocrl enzyme. other mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of the enzyme or prevent it from interacting with other proteins within the cell. researchers are working to determine how ocrl mutations cause the characteristic features of lowe syndrome. because the ocrl enzyme is present throughout the body, it is unclear why the medical problems associated with this condition are mostly limited to the brain, kidneys, and eyes. it is possible that other enzymes may be able to compensate for the defective ocrl enzyme in unaffected tissues."

what is (are) hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia ?,"hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is an inherited condition caused by the body's inability to absorb and retain magnesium that is taken in through the diet. as a result, magnesium levels in the blood are severely low (hypomagnesemia).  hypomagnesemia impairs the function of the parathyroid glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located in the neck. normally, the parathyroid glands release a hormone that increases blood calcium levels when they are low. magnesium is required for the production and release of parathyroid hormone, so when magnesium is too low, insufficient parathyroid hormone is produced and blood calcium levels are also reduced (hypocalcemia). the hypocalcemia is described as ""secondary"" because it occurs as a consequence of hypomagnesemia.  shortages of magnesium and calcium can cause neurological problems that begin in infancy, including painful muscle spasms (tetany) and seizures. if left untreated, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia can lead to developmental delay, intellectual disability, a failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and heart failure."
is pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 inherited ?,"pha1 can have different inheritance patterns. when the condition is caused by mutations in the nr3c2 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. when pha1 is caused by mutations in the scnn1a, scnn1b, or scnn1g genes, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for syringomyelia ?,"the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. ninds investigators are studying how syrinxes first form, as well as the mechanisms of the disorders. ninds investigators have found that the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid that occurs with each heartbeat is obstructed in people with syringomyelia. surgical procedures that relieve this obstruction usually result in the syrinx becoming much smaller in size. studies are also underway to identify and better understand genetic factors that influence the development of chiari i malformations and syringomyelia. researchers hope to better understand the role of birth defects of the skull and brain in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia. diagnostic technology is another area for continued research. 
                
ninds scientists are examining individuals who either have syringomyelia or are at risk of developing the disorder. they are investigating the factors that influence its development, progression, and treatment by recording more than 5 years of symptoms, muscle strength, overall function, and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan findings from individuals who receive standard treatment for syringomyelia. study results may allow scientists to provide more accurate recommendations to future individuals with syringomyelia regarding optimal surgical or non-surgical treatments."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with parathyroid cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with parathyroid cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    treatment includes control of hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) in patients who have an overactive parathyroid gland.
                    in order to reduce the amount of parathyroid hormone that is being made and control the level of calcium in the blood, as much of the tumor as possible is removed in surgery. for patients who cannot have surgery, medication may be used.
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery    surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for parathyroid cancer that is in the parathyroid glands or has spread to other parts of the body. because parathyroid cancer grows very slowly, cancer that has spread to other parts of the body may be removed by surgery in order to cure the patient or control the effects of the disease for a long time. before surgery, treatment is given to control hypercalcemia.     the following surgical procedures may be used:            - en bloc resection: surgery to remove the entire parathyroid gland and the capsule around it. sometimes lymph nodes, half of the thyroid gland on the same side of the body as the cancer, and muscles, tissues, and a nerve in the neck are also removed.     -  tumor debulking: a surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed. some tumors cannot be completely removed.     -  metastasectomy: surgery to remove any cancer that has spread to distant organs such as the lung.             surgery for parathyroid cancer sometimes damages nerves of the vocal cords. there are treatments to help with speech problems caused by this nerve damage.       radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat parathyroid cancer.       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       supportive care     supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. supportive care for hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid cancer may include the following:            -  intravenous (iv) fluids.     - drugs that increase how much urine the body makes.     - drugs that stop the body from absorbing calcium from the food we eat.     - drugs that stop the parathyroid gland from making parathyroid hormone.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   parathyroid cancer often recurs. patients should have regular check-ups for the rest of their lives, to find and treat recurrences early.

what are the genetic changes related to medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"mutations in the acadm gene cause mcad deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase, which is required to break down (metabolize) a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. these fatty acids are found in foods and the body's fat tissues. fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. during periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  mutations in the acadm gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the mcad enzyme within cells. without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. as a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. this abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of mcad deficiency."
how to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism ?,"once the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is established, other tests may be done to assess complications:
                
- bone mineral density test. dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, sometimes called a dxa or dexa scan, uses low-dose x rays to measure bone density. during the test, a person lies on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over the persons body. dxa scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician and may be interpreted by a metabolic bone disease expert or radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingor other specialists; anesthesia is not needed. the test can help assess bone loss and risk of fractures.  - ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show the presence of kidney stones.  - computerized tomography (ct) scan. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-d) images. a ct scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. ct scans can show the presence of kidney stones.  - urine collection. a 24-hour urine collection may be done to measure selected chemicals, such as calcium and creatinine, which is a waste product healthy kidneys remove. the person collects urine over a 24-hour period, and the urine is sent to a laboratory for analysis. the urine collection may provide information on kidney damage, the risk of kidney stone formation, and the risk of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.  - 25-hydroxy-vitamin d blood test. this test is recommended because vitamin d deficiency is common in people with primary hyperparathyroidism."

who is at risk for kidney disease? ?,"diabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading risk factors for kidney disease. both diabetes and high blood pressure damage the small blood vessels in your kidneys and can cause kidney disease -- without you feeling it.  there are several other risk factors for kidney disease. cardiovascular (heart) disease is a risk factor. so is family history: if you have a mother, father, sister, or brother who has had kidney disease, then you are at increased risk. african americans, hispanics, and native americans tend to have a greater risk for kidney failure. this is mostly due to higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure in these communities, although there may be other reasons.

what are the genetic changes related to x-linked congenital stationary night blindness ?,"mutations in the nyx and cacna1f genes cause the complete and incomplete forms of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness, respectively. the proteins produced from these genes play critical roles in the retina.  within the retina, the nyx and cacna1f proteins are located on the surface of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. the retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. rods are needed for vision in low light. cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. the nyx and cacna1f proteins ensure that visual signals are passed from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells, which is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.  mutations in the nyx or cacna1f gene disrupt the transmission of visual signals between photoreceptors and retinal bipolar cells, which impairs vision. in people with the complete form of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness (resulting from nyx mutations), the function of rods is severely disrupted, while the function of cones is only mildly affected. in people with the incomplete form of the condition (resulting from cacna1f mutations), rods and cones are both affected, although they retain some ability to detect light."

what are the genetic changes related to hypermethioninemia ?,"mutations in the ahcy, gnmt, and mat1a genes cause hypermethioninemia.  inherited hypermethioninemia that is not associated with other metabolic disorders can be caused by shortages (deficiencies) in the enzymes that break down methionine. these enzymes are produced from the mat1a, gnmt and ahcy genes. the reactions involved in metabolizing methionine help supply some of the amino acids needed for protein production. these reactions are also involved in transferring methyl groups, consisting of a carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, from one molecule to another (transmethylation), which is important in many cellular processes.  the mat1a gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase. this enzyme converts methionine into a compound called s-adenosylmethionine, also known as adomet or same. the gnmt gene provides instructions for making the enzyme glycine n-methyltransferase. this enzyme starts the next step in the process, converting adomet to a compound called s-adenosyl homocysteine, or adohcy. the ahcy gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. this enzyme converts the adohcy into the compound homocysteine. homocysteine may be converted back to methionine or into another amino acid, cysteine.  a deficiency of any of these enzymes results in a buildup of methionine in the body, and may cause signs and symptoms related to hypermethioninemia."

what are the genetic changes related to myh9-related disorder ?,"myh9-related disorder is caused by mutations in the myh9 gene. the myh9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin-9. this protein is one part (subunit) of the myosin iia protein.  there are three forms of myosin ii, called myosin iia, myosin iib and myosin iic. the three forms are found throughout the body and perform similar functions. they play roles in cell movement (cell motility); maintenance of cell shape; and cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. while some cells use more than one type of myosin ii, certain blood cells such as platelets and white blood cells (leukocytes) use only myosin iia.  myh9 gene mutations that cause myh9-related disorder typically result in a nonfunctional version of the myosin-9 protein. the nonfunctional protein cannot properly interact with other subunits to form myosin iia. platelets and leukocytes, which only use myosin iia, are most affected by a lack of functional myosin-9. it is thought that a lack of functional myosin iia leads to the release of large, immature platelets in the bloodstream, resulting in a reduced amount of normal platelets. in leukocytes, the nonfunctional myosin-9 clumps together. these clumps of protein, called inclusion bodies, are a hallmark of myh9-related disorder and are present in the leukocytes of everyone with this condition."
what causes gum (periodontal) disease ?,"if your hands have become stiff because of arthritis or if you have a physical disability, you may find it difficult to use your toothbrush or dental floss. the following tips might make it easier for you to clean your teeth and gums. make the toothbrush easier to hold. the same kind of velcro strap used to hold food utensils is helpful for some people. make the toothbrush handle bigger. you can cut a small slit in the side of a tennis ball and slide it onto the handle of the toothbrush. you can also buy a toothbrush with a large handle, or you can slide a bicycle grip onto the handle. attaching foam tubing, available from home health care catalogs, is also helpful. try other toothbrush options. a power toothbrush might make brushing easier. some people may find that it takes time to get used to a power toothbrush. a floss holder can make it easier to hold the dental floss. also, talk with your dentist about whether an oral irrigation system, special small brushes, or other instruments that clean between teeth are right for you. be sure to check with your dentist, though, before using any of these methods since they may injure the gums if used improperly."
what causes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?,"what causes multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1? multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (men1) is caused by mutations in the men1 gene. men1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. changes (mutations) in men1 result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. this leads to the development of the many different types of tumors found in men1."
what are the symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for acrodermatitis enteropathica. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal blistering of the skin 90% abnormality of the eyebrow 90% alopecia 90% cerebral cortical atrophy 90% diarrhea 90% dry skin 90% malabsorption 90% pustule 90% short stature 90% abnormality of the fingernails 50% abnormality of the toenails 50% cheilitis 50% furrowed tongue 50% glossitis 50% inflammatory abnormality of the eye 50% photophobia 50% skin ulcer 50% anorexia 7.5% corneal erosion 7.5% visual impairment 7.5% weight loss 7.5% alopecia of scalp - ataxia - autosomal recessive inheritance - decreased taste sensation - decreased testicular size - decreased testosterone in males - emotional lability - failure to thrive - hepatomegaly - hypogonadism - impaired t cell function - infantile onset - irritability - lethargy - low alkaline phosphatase - paronychia - poor appetite - recurrent candida infections - splenomegaly - tremor - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
how to diagnose pars planitis ?,"how is pars planitis diagnosed? pars planitis is typically diagnosed based on a specialized eye examination. during the exam, the ophthalmologist will typically see clusters of white blood cells trapped within the eyeball that are called snowballs (or ""inflammatory exudate""). if these clusters are located on the pars plana, they are known as snowbanks. snowbanks are considered a ""hallmark"" sign of pars planitis. it is often recommended that people over age 25 with pars planitis have an mri of their brain and spine to rule out multiple sclerosis."
what are the genetic changes related to desmoid tumor ?,"mutations in the ctnnb1 gene or the apc gene cause desmoid tumors. ctnnb1 gene mutations account for around 85 percent of sporadic desmoid tumors. apc gene mutations cause desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis as well as 10 to 15 percent of sporadic desmoid tumors. both genes are involved in an important cell signaling pathway that controls the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation).  the ctnnb1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-catenin. as part of the cell-signaling pathway, beta-catenin interacts with other proteins to control the activity (expression) of particular genes, which helps promote cell proliferation and differentiation. ctnnb1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally stable beta-catenin protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed. the protein accumulates in cells, where it continues to function in an uncontrolled way.  the protein produced from the apc gene helps regulate levels of beta-catenin in the cell. when beta-catenin is no longer needed, the apc protein attaches (binds) to it, which signals for it to be broken down. mutations in the apc gene that cause desmoid tumors lead to a short apc protein that is unable to interact with beta-catenin. as a result, beta-catenin is not broken down and, instead, accumulates in cells. excess beta-catenin, whether caused by ctnnb1 or apc gene mutations, promotes uncontrolled growth and division of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors."
is congenital central hypoventilation syndrome inherited ?,"how is congenital central hypoventilation syndrome inherited? congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (cchs) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. the genetics of cchs can be complex. most people with cchs have a new (de novo) mutation in the responsible gene (the phox2b gene). de novo mutations occur for the first time in the affected person and are not inherited from a parent. some people with cchs have a parent with the condition, and inherit the mutation from that parent. in some cases, an asymptomatic parent of a person with symptoms has a phox2b mutation in some of their germ cells (egg or sperm cells, not body cells). this is called germline mosaicism. some of these parents also have a phox2b mutation in some of their body cells. this is called somatic mosaicism. germline mosaicism with or without somatic mosaicism is present in about 25% of asymptomatic parents of people with cchs. parents with mosaicism should have a comprehensive assessment to determine if any features of cchs are present. it is also recommended that parents of a person with a presumed de novo mutation have genetic testing for the presence of the mutation, including testing that detects mosaicism at low levels."
what is (are) x-linked sideroblastic anemia ?,"x-linked sideroblastic anemia is an inherited disorder that prevents developing red blood cells (erythroblasts) from making enough hemoglobin. people with x-linked sideroblastic anemia have mature red blood cells that are smaller than normal (microcytic) and appear pale (hypochromic) because of the shortage of hemoglobin. this disorder also leads to an abnormal accumulation of iron in red blood cells. the iron-loaded erythroblasts, which are present in bone marrow, are called ring sideroblasts. these abnormal cells give the condition its name. the signs and symptoms of x-linked sideroblastic anemia result from a combination of reduced hemoglobin and an overload of iron. they range from mild to severe and most often appear in young adulthood. common features include fatigue, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, pale skin, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). over time, severe medical problems such as heart disease and liver damage (cirrhosis) can result from the buildup of excess iron in these organs. x-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutation in the alas2 gene. in rare cases, mutations are found in both the hfe gene and the alas2 gene, resulting in a more severe form of x-linked sideroblastic anemia. x-linked sideroblastic anemia is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern."
what causes punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type i ?,"what causes palmoplantar keratoderma type 1? punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 is a condition that is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. it has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in the aagab gene in several families. although the exact function of the aagab gene is currently unknown, the gene is thought to play an important role in skin integrity."
what is (are) pregnancy and thyroid disease ?,"thyroid disease is a disorder that affects the thyroid gland. sometimes the body produces too much or too little thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones regulate metabolismthe way the body uses energyand affect nearly every organ in the body. too much thyroid hormone is called hyperthyroidism and can cause many of the bodys functions to speed up. too little thyroid hormone is called hypothyroidism and can cause many of the bodys functions to slow down.
                
thyroid hormone plays a critical role during pregnancy both in the development of a healthy baby and in maintaining the health of the mother.
                
women with thyroid problems can have a healthy pregnancy and protect their fetuses health by learning about pregnancys effect on the thyroid, keeping current on their thyroid function testing, and taking the required medications."
do you have information about caffeine,"summary : caffeine is a bitter substance found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, chocolate, kola nuts, and certain medicines. it has many effects on the body's metabolism, including stimulating the central nervous system. this can make you more alert and give you a boost of energy.     for most people, the amount of caffeine in two to four cups of coffee a day is not harmful. however, too much caffeine can cause problems. it can       - make you jittery and shaky    - make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep    - cause headaches or dizziness    - make your heart beat faster or cause abnormal heart rhythms    - cause dehydration    - make you dependent on it so you need to take more of it. if you stop using caffeine, you could get withdrawal symptoms.       some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. they should limit their use of caffeine. so should pregnant and nursing women. certain drugs and supplements may interact with caffeine. if you have questions about whether caffeine is safe for you, talk with your health care provider.    food and drug administration"
what is (are) familial hyperaldosteronism ?,"familial hyperaldosteronism is a group of inherited conditions in which the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney, produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. aldosterone helps control the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and blood pressure. people with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), often early in life. without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure.  familial hyperaldosteronism is categorized into three types, distinguished by their clinical features and genetic causes. in familial hyperaldosteronism type i, hypertension generally appears in childhood to early adulthood and can range from mild to severe. this type can be treated with steroid medications called glucocorticoids, so it is also known as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (gra). in familial hyperaldosteronism type ii, hypertension usually appears in early to middle adulthood and does not improve with glucocorticoid treatment. in most individuals with familial hyperaldosteronism type iii, the adrenal glands are enlarged up to six times their normal size. these affected individuals have severe hypertension that starts in childhood. the hypertension is difficult to treat and often results in damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys. rarely, individuals with type iii have milder symptoms with treatable hypertension and no adrenal gland enlargement.  there are other forms of hyperaldosteronism that are not familial. these conditions are caused by various problems in the adrenal glands or kidneys. in some cases, a cause for the increase in aldosterone levels cannot be found."
what is (are) andersen-tawil syndrome ?,"andersen-tawil syndrome is a type of long qt syndrome and is also considered a rare form of periodic paralysis. it causes episodes of muscle weakness, changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and developmental abnormalities. physical abnormalities associated with this condition typically affect the head, face, and limbs. about 60% of cases of andersen-tawil syndrome are caused by mutations in the kcnj2 gene. the cause of the remaining cases remains unknown. this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."

what is (are) parasites - scabies ?,"scabies is an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). the microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. the most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash. the scabies mite usually is spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies.
scabies is found worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes. scabies can spread rapidly under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is frequent. institutions such as nursing homes, extended-care facilities, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks. child care facilities also are a common site of scabies infestations."
what causes systemic scleroderma ?,"what causes systemic scleroderma? the exact, underlying cause of systemic sclerosis is unknown. the cause appears to involve some injury to the cells that line blood vessels, resulting in excessive activation of dermal connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts. fibroblasts normally produce collagen and other proteins. build-up of collagen in the skin and other organs causes the signs and symptoms of the condition. it is suspected that scleroderma may develop from a variety of factors, which may include: abnormal immune or inflammatory activity genetic susceptibility: while no specific genes are thought to cause scleroderma, certain genes (or combination of genes) may increase a person's risk to be affected. however, the condition is not passed directly from parents to children. environmental triggers: suspected triggers may include infections; injury; drugs (e.g. vitamin k, cocaine, penicillamine, appetite suppressants and some chemotherapeutic agents); and chemicals (e.g. silica, organic solvents, pesticides, aliphatic hydrocarbons and epoxy resin). hormones: because women develop scleroderma more often than men, researchers suspect that hormones may play a role. however, the role of female hormones has not been proven. widespread scleroderma can also occur in association with other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and polymyositis."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
                    different types of treatment are available for children with wilms and other childhood kidney tumors. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    children with wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    your child's treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists:         -  pediatrician.    -  pediatric surgeon or urologist.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.    -  pediatric nurse specialist.    -  social worker.
                
                
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:          - physical problems, such as heart problems, kidney problems, or problems during pregnancy.    - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  second cancers (new types of cancer), such as cancer of the gastrointestinal tract or breast cancer.        some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary about late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information).     clinical trials are being done to find out if lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation can be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works.
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery    two types of surgery are used to treat kidney tumors:            -  nephrectomy: wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy (surgery to remove the whole kidney). nearby lymph nodes may also be removed and checked for signs of cancer. sometimes a kidney transplant (surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a donor) is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well.     -  partial nephrectomy: if cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys, surgery may include a partial nephrectomy (removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal tissue around it). partial nephrectomy is done to keep as much of the kidney working as possible. a partial nephrectomy is also called renal-sparing surgery.           even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk of the cancer coming back, is called adjuvant therapy. sometimes, a second-look surgery is done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether a biopsy was done before surgery to remove the tumor. external radiation therapy is used to treat wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. systemic chemotherapy is used to treat wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.    sometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons:            - the tumor is too close to important organs or blood vessels.     - the tumor is too large to remove.     - the cancer is in both kidneys.     - there is a blood clot in the vessels near the liver.     - the patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the lungs.            in this case, a biopsy is done first. then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. radiation therapy is given after surgery.    see drugs approved for wilms tumor and other childhood kidney cancers for more information.       biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     interferon and interleukin-2 (il-2) are types of biologic therapy used to treat childhood renal cell cancer. interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth. il-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.       high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these re-infused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat recurrent wilms tumor.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

how to prevent diabetic kidney disease ?,"people can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by
                
- taking medications to control high blood pressure  - managing blood glucose levels  - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition  - losing weight if they are overweight or obese  - getting regular physical activity
                
people with diabetes should see a health care provider who will help them learn to manage their diabetes and monitor their diabetes control. most people with diabetes get care from primary care providers, including internists, family practice doctors, or pediatricians. however, having a team of health care providers can often improve diabetes care. in addition to a primary care provider, the team can include
                
- an endocrinologista doctor with special training in diabetes  - a nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating people who have kidney problems or related conditions  - diabetes educators such as a nurse or dietitian  - a podiatrista doctor who specializes in foot care  - an ophthalmologist or optometrist for eye care  - a pharmacist  - a dentist  - a mental health counselor for emotional support and access to community resources
                
the team can also include other health care providers and specialists.
                
blood pressure medications
                
medications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. a person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.
                
people should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.
                
managing blood glucose levels
                
people manage blood glucose levels by
                
- testing blood glucose throughout the day  - following a diet and physical activity plan  - taking insulin throughout the day based on food and liquid intake and physical activity
                
people with diabetes need to talk with their health care team regularly and follow their directions closely. the goal is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range or within a range set by the persons health care team. more information about diabetes is provided in the niddk health topics:
                
- national diabetes statistics report, 2014  - diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes
                
eating, diet, and nutrition
                
following a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure and control blood sugar. a health care provider may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan. dash focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. the dash eating plan
                
- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, and fewer sweets, added sugars, and sugarcontaining beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber
                
read more about dash at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.
                
people with diabetic kidney disease may need to limit sodium and salt intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. a dietitian may also recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.
                
health care providers may recommend that people with ckd eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet are still being researched. proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. however, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. more information about diabetes and diet is provided in the niddk health topics:

weight loss and physical activity
                
health care providers recommend that people who are overweight or obese lose weight to improve their bodies ability to use insulin properly and lower their risk for health problems related to high blood pressure. overweight is defined as a body mass index (bmi)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. a bmi of 30 or higher is considered obese. people should aim to keep their bmi lower than 25.4
                
experts recommend physical activity as an important part of losing weight, keeping sensitivity to insulin, and treating high blood pressure. most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. a person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, what i need to know about physical activity and diabetes."

is gm1 gangliosidosis inherited ?,"how is gm1 gangliosidosis inherited? gm1 gangliosidosis is a hereditary condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). when 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has: a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier gm1 gangliosidosis is type-specific within families. this means that people with a family history of the condition are generally only at increased risk for the specific type of gm1 gangliosidosis in the family."
what are the genetic changes related to complement factor i deficiency ?,"complement factor i deficiency is caused by mutations in the cfi gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor i. this protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. the complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. this system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. complement factor i and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.  mutations in the cfi gene that cause complement factor i deficiency result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor i. the lack (deficiency) of functional complement factor i protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. the unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called c3, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. in addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders."

what are the genetic changes related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ?,"mutations in the serpina1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which protects the body from a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase. neutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (especially the lungs) if not tightly controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin.  mutations in the serpina1 gene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. without enough functional alpha-1 antitrypsin, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli and causes lung disease. abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin can also accumulate in the liver and damage this organ.  environmental factors, such as exposure to tobacco smoke, chemicals, and dust, likely impact the severity of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency."
what are the symptoms of mccune albright syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mccune albright syndrome? people with mccune albright syndrome (mas) may have symptoms related to bones, the endocrine system, and/or skin. the symptoms can range from mild to severe. bone symptoms may include: polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: this is when normal bone is replaced by softer, fibrous tissue. polyostotic means the abnormal areas may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. when it occurs in skull and jaw it can result in uneven growth of the face. this may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) cancer: bone lesions may become cancerous, but this happens in less than 1% of people with mas. endocrine symptoms may include: early puberty: girls with mas usually reach puberty early. they often have menstrual bleeding by age 2 (as early as 4-6 months in some), many years before characteristics such as breast enlargement and pubic hair growth are evident. this early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, a female sex hormone produced by cysts that develop in one of the ovaries. less commonly, boys with mas may also experience early puberty. enlarged thyroid gland: the thyroid gland may become enlarged (a condition called a goiter) or develop masses called nodules. about half of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. increased production of growth hormone: the pituitary gland may produce too much growth hormone. this can result in acromegaly, a condition characterized by large hands and feet, arthritis, and distinctive facial features that are often described as ""coarse."" cushings syndrome: rarely, individuals with mas produce too much of the hormone cortisol in the adrenal glands. cushing's syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. skin symptoms may include: cafe-au-lait spots: individuals with mas usually have light brown patches of skin called cafe-au-lait spots. like the bone lesions, these spots often appear on only one side of the body. most children have these spots from birth and the spots rarely grow. there are usually not any medical problems caused by these skin changes. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mccune albright syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) bone pain 90% cafe-au-lait spot 90% generalized hyperpigmentation 90% hypophosphatemia 90% precocious puberty 90% recurrent fractures 90% reduced bone mineral density 90% skeletal dysplasia 90% abnormality of coagulation 7.5% abnormality of dental enamel 7.5% abnormality of the palate 7.5% carious teeth 7.5% dental malocclusion 7.5% elevated hepatic transaminases 7.5% goiter 7.5% hearing abnormality 7.5% hypercortisolism 7.5% hyperparathyroidism 7.5% hyperthyroidism 7.5% kyphosis 7.5% long penis 7.5% macrocephaly 7.5% macroorchidism 7.5% mandibular prognathia 7.5% neoplasm of the breast 7.5% neoplasm of the thyroid gland 7.5% optic atrophy 7.5% polycystic ovaries 7.5% sarcoma 7.5% tall stature 7.5% testicular neoplasm 7.5% blindness - craniofacial hyperostosis - facial asymmetry - growth hormone excess - hearing impairment - intestinal polyposis - large cafe-au-lait macules with irregular margins - pathologic fracture - phenotypic variability - pituitary adenoma - polyostotic fibrous dysplasia - prolactin excess - somatic mosaicism - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the genetic changes related to spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome ?,"mutations in the flnb gene cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. the flnb gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin b. this protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin b attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. it also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development.  filamin b is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. it is active (expressed) in the cell membranes of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears. filamin b appears to be important for normal cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage.  flnb gene mutations that cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome result in the production of an abnormally short filamin b protein that is unstable and breaks down rapidly. loss of the filamin b protein appears to result in out-of-place (ectopic) ossification, resulting in fusion of the bones in the spine, wrists, and ankles and other signs and symptoms of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.  a few individuals who have been diagnosed with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome do not have mutations in the flnb gene. in these cases, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown."
how to diagnose leukemia ?,there are no standard or over-the-counter tests for leukemia. your doctor can request lab analyses for leukemia that include blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells. the doctor may also look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow or the fluid around the brain or the spinal cord
what causes camurati-engelmann disease ?,"what causes camurati-engelmann disease? mutations in the tgfb1 gene cause camurati-engelmann disease. the tgfb1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (tgf-1). the tgf-1 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). the tgf-1 protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth, the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. tgf-1 is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). within cells, the tgf-1 protein is turned off (inactive) until it receives a chemical signal to become active. the tgfb1 gene mutations that cause camurati-engelmann disease result in the production of a tgf-1 protein that is always turned on (active). overactive tgf-1 proteins lead to increased bone density and decreased body fat and muscle tissue, contributing to the signs and symptoms of camurati-engelmann disease. some individuals with camurati-engelmnan disease do not have identified mutations in the tgfb1 gene. in these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."
what is (are) trigeminal neuralgia ?,"trigeminal neuralgia (tn), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. the painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. the intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. tn pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. in the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. the attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. the intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. tn occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. there is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening.
                
the presumed cause of tn is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. tn may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves."
what is (are) ring chromosome 20 syndrome ?,"ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a condition that affects the normal development and function of the brain. the most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. the seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. they are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. in many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. these episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features. major birth defects are rarely seen with ring chromosome 20 syndrome."
is polycythemia vera inherited ?,"most cases of polycythemia vera are not inherited. this condition is associated with genetic changes that are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.  in rare instances, polycythemia vera has been found to run in families. in some of these families, the risk of developing polycythemia vera appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing polycythemia vera, although the cause of this condition in familial cases is unknown. in these families, people seem to inherit an increased risk of polycythemia vera, not the disease itself."
how to diagnose acanthamoeba - granulomatous amebic encephalitis (gae); keratitis ?,"early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment of acanthamoeba keratitis. the infection is usually diagnosed by an eye specialist based on symptoms, growth of the ameba from a scraping of the eye, and/or seeing the ameba by a process called confocal microscopy.
    
granulomatous amebic encephalitis (gae) and disseminated infection are more difficult to diagnose and are often at advanced stages when they are diagnosed. tests useful in the diagnosis of gae include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps. in disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites (e.g. , skin, sinuses) can be useful in diagnosis."
is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited ?,"is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited? most cases of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots) are not thought to be inherited. although the condition generally occurs sporadically, some people with pots do report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). this suggests that inherited factors may play a role in the development of pots in some families."
what causes creutzfeldt-jakob disease ?,"what causes creutzfeldt-jakob disease? some researchers believe an unusual 'slow virus' or another organism causes creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd). however, they have never been able to isolate a virus or other organism in people with the disease. furthermore, the agent that causes cjd has several characteristics that are unusual for known organisms such as viruses and bacteria. it is difficult to kill, it does not appear to contain any genetic information in the form of nucleic acids (dna or rna), and it usually has a long incubation period before symptoms appear. in some cases, the incubation period may be as long as 40 years. the leading scientific theory at this time maintains that cjd and the other tses are caused by a type of protein called a prion. prion proteins occur in both a normal form, which is a harmless protein found in the bodys cells, and in an infectious form, which causes disease. the harmless and infectious forms of the prion protein have the same sequence of amino acids (the 'building blocks' of proteins) but the infectious form of the protein takes a different folded shape than the normal protein. sporadic cjd may develop because some of a persons normal prions spontaneously change into the infectious form of the protein and then alter the prions in other cells in a chain reaction. once they appear, abnormal prion proteins aggregate, or clump together. investigators think these protein aggregates may lead to the neuron loss and other brain damage seen in cjd. however, they do not know exactly how this damage occurs. about 5 to 10 percent of all cjd cases are inherited. these cases arise from a mutation, or change, in the gene that controls formation of the normal prion protein. while prions themselves do not contain genetic information and do not require genes to reproduce themselves, infectious prions can arise if a mutation occurs in the gene for the bodys normal prion protein. if the prion protein gene is altered in a persons sperm or egg cells, the mutation can be transmitted to the persons offspring. several different mutations in the prion gene have been identified. the particular mutation found in each family affects how frequently the disease appears and what symptoms are most noticeable. however, not all people with mutations in the prion protein gene develop cjd."
what are the treatments for familial periodic paralyses ?,"treatment of the periodic paralyses focuses on preventing further attacks and relieving acute symptoms. avoiding carbohydrate-rich meals and strenuous exercise, and taking acetazolamide daily may prevent hypokalemic attacks. attacks can be managed by drinking a potassium chloride oral solution. eating carbohydrate-rich, low-potassium foods, and avoiding strenuous exercise and fasting, can help prevent hyperkalemic attacks. dichorphenamide may prevent attacks."

is familial exudative vitreoretinopathy inherited ?,"familial exudative vitreoretinopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. most commonly, the condition results from mutations in the fzd4 or lrp5 gene and has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. most people with autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy inherit the altered gene from a parent, although the parent may not have any signs and symptoms associated with this disorder.  familial exudative vitreoretinopathy caused by lrp5 gene mutations can also have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with autosomal recessive familial exudative vitreoretinopathy each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they do not have the disorder.  when familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is caused by mutations in the ndp gene, it has an x-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. the ndp gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what is the outlook for childhood soft tissue sarcoma ?,certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - the part of the body where the tumor first formed.    - the size and grade of the tumor.    - the type of soft tissue sarcoma.    - how deep the tumor is under the skin.    - whether the tumor has spread to other places in the body.    - the amount of tumor remaining after surgery to remove it.    - whether radiation therapy was used to treat the tumor.    - the age and gender of the patient.    - whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
what are the treatments for syncope ?,"the immediate treatment for an individual who has fainted involves checking first to see if their airway is open and they are breathing. the person should remain lying down for at least 10-15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet space. if this isnt possible, have the individual sit forward and lower their head below their shoulders and between their knees. ice or cold water in a cup is refreshing. for individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting. at the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell. if fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease."

"what are the treatments for blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1 ?","how might blepharophimosis syndrome type 1 be treated? management of blepharophimosis syndrome type 1 requires the input of several specialists including a clinical geneticist, pediatric ophthalmologist, eye plastic (oculoplastic) surgeon, endocrinologist, reproductive endocrinologist, and gynecologist. eyelid surgery should be discussed with an oculoplastic surgeon to decide on the method and timing that is best suited for the patient. traditionally, surgical correction of the blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus (canthoplasty) is performed at ages three to five years, followed about a year later by ptosis correction (usually requiring a brow suspension procedure). if the epicanthal folds are small, a ""y-v canthoplasty"" is traditionally used; if the epicanthal folds are severe, a ""double z-plasty"" is used. unpublished reports have indicated that advanced understanding of the lower eyelid position has allowed for more targeted surgery that results in a more natural appearance.   for a general explanation of these procedures and to locate an eye-care professional visit the foundation of the american academy of ophthalmology and the national eye institute websites. to locate a surgeon through the american society of ophthalmic plastic & reconstructive surgery click here. generally, premature ovarian failure (pof) is treated with hormone replacement therapy. there is no specific treatment for pof caused by blepharophimosis syndrome type 1. hormone replacement therapy is generally estrogen and progesterone and sometimes also includes testosterone. birth control pills are sometimes substituted for hormone replacement therapy. although health care providers can suggest treatments for some of the symptoms of pof, currently there is no scientifically established treatment to restore fertility for women diagnosed with pof. women with pof are encouraged to speak to a health care professional. if you wish to obtain more information and support, you can visit the international premature ovarian failure association."

how many people are affected by infantile systemic hyalinosis ?,the prevalence of infantile systemic hyalinosis is unknown. fewer than 20 people with this disorder have been reported.
how to diagnose alagille syndrome ?,"a health care provider diagnoses alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and ordering one or more of the following tests and exams:
                
- blood test  - urinalysis  - x ray  - abdominal ultrasound  - cardiology exam  - slit-lamp exam  - liver biopsy  - genetic testing
                
alagille syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms vary and the syndrome is so rare.
                
for a diagnosis of alagille syndrome, three of the following symptoms typically should be present:
                
- liver symptoms, such as jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption, and xanthomas  - heart abnormalities or murmurs  - skeletal abnormalities  - posterior embryotoxon  - facial features typical of alagille syndrome  - kidney disease  - blood vessel problems
                
a health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose alagille syndrome; however, it is not necessary to make a diagnosis. a diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of jag1. the health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the jag1 gene mutation. the gene mutation can be identified in 94 percent of people with a diagnosis of alagille syndrome.2
                
blood test. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function.
                
urinalysis. urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample. the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems. the sample may be observed for color, cloudiness, or concentration; signs of drug use; chemical composition, including glucose; the presence of protein, blood cells, or bacteria; or other signs of disease.
                
x ray. an x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. the amount of radiation used is small. an x-ray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. the patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. the technician positions the x-ray machine over the spine area to look for ""butterfly"" vertebrae. the patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. the patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures.
                
abdominal ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. in abdominal ultrasound, the health care provider applies a gel to the patient's abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin. the gel allows the transducer to glide easily, and it improves the transmission of the signals. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions.
                
cardiology exam. a cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. during a full exam, a cardiologist may inspect the patient's physical appearance, measure pulse rate and blood pressure, observe the jugular vein, check for rapid or skipped heartbeats, listen for variations in heart sounds, and listen to the lungs.
                
slit-lamp exam. an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slit-lamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon. the ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp, a microscope combined with a high-intensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye. while sitting in a chair, the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp. a yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer. the dye is applied as a drop, or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patient's eye. the specialist will also use drops in the patient's eye to dilate the pupil.
                
liver biopsy. a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. the patient may be asked to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.
                
during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. a local anesthetic is applied to the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted. if needed, sedatives and pain medication are also given. the health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. the health care provider may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. after the biopsy, the patient should lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
genetic testing. the health care provider may refer a person suspected of having alagille syndrome to a geneticista doctor who specializes in genetic disorders. for a genetic test, the geneticist takes a blood or saliva sample and analyzes the dna for the jag1 gene mutation. the geneticist tests for the jag1 gene mutation first, since it is more common in alagille syndrome than notch2. genetic testing is often done only by specialized labs. the results may not be available for several months because of the complexity of the testing.
                
the usefulness of genetic testing for alagille syndrome is limited by two factors:
                
- detection of a mutated gene cannot predict the onset of symptoms or how serious the disorder will be.  - even if a mutated gene is found, no specific cure for the disorder exists.
                

                
when to consider genetic counseling   people who are considering genetic testing may want to consult a genetics counselor. genetic counseling can help family members understand how test results may affect them individually and as a family. genetic counseling is provided by genetics professionalshealth care professionals with specialized degrees and experience in medical genetics and counseling. genetics professionals include geneticists, genetics counselors, and genetics nurses.   genetics professionals work as members of health care teams, providing information and support to individuals or families who have genetic disorders or a higher chance of having an inherited condition. genetics professionals   - assess the likelihood of a genetic disorder by researching a family's history, evaluating medical records, and conducting a physical exam of the patient and other family members   - weigh the medical, social, and ethical decisions surrounding genetic testing   - provide support and information to help a person make a decision about testing   - interpret the results of genetic tests and medical data   - provide counseling or refer individuals and families to support services   - serve as patient advocates   - explain possible treatments or preventive measures   - discuss reproductive options    genetic counseling may be useful when a family member is deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available."

is kleefstra syndrome inherited ?,"the inheritance of kleefstra syndrome is considered to be autosomal dominant because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell or a mutation in one copy of the ehmt1 gene is sufficient to cause the condition. most cases of kleefstra syndrome are not inherited, however. the genetic change occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family, though they can pass the disorder on to their children. only a few people with kleefstra syndrome have been known to reproduce.  rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome 9 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. in these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. individuals with kleefstra syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 9.  a few individuals with kleefstra syndrome have inherited the chromosome 9q34.3 deletion from an unaffected parent who is mosaic for the deletion. mosaic means that an individual has the deletion in some cells (including some sperm or egg cells), but not in others."
what are the treatments for cold urticaria ?,"how might cold urticaria be treated? the treatment of cold urticaria generally consists of patient education, avoiding scenarios that may trigger a reaction (i.e. cold temperatures, cold water), and/or medications. prophylactic treatment with high-dose antihistimines may be recommended when exposure to cold is expected and can not be avoided. additionally, affected people are often told to carry an epinephrine autoinjector due to the increased risk of anaphylaxis. several other therapies have reportedly been used to treat cold urticaria with varying degrees of success. these include: leukotriene antagonists ciclosporin systemic corticosteroids dapsone oral antibiotics synthetic hormones danazol"
is muir-torre syndrome inherited ?,"how is muir-torre syndrome inherited? muir-torre-syndrome (mts) is a variant of lynch syndrome and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough for a person to develop the condition. when a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the responsible gene. it is important to note that people who inherit a mutated gene that causes mts inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. not all people who inherit a mutation in an associated gene will develop cancer. this phenomenon is called reduced penetrance. the majority of people diagnosed with a form of lynch syndrome have inherited the mutated gene from a parent. however, because not all people with a mutation develop cancer, and the variable age at which cancer may develop, not all people with a mutation have a parent who had cancer. thus, the family history may appear negative. a positive family history of mts is identified in roughly 50% of affected people. the percentage of people with lynch syndrome who have a new mutation in the gene that occurred for the first time (and was not inherited from a parent) is unknown but is estimated to be extremely low."

what causes rheumatoid arthritis ?,"actual cause is unknown scientists believe that rheumatoid arthritis may result from the interaction of many factors such as genetics, hormones, and the environment. although rheumatoid arthritis sometimes runs in families, the actual cause of rheumatoid arthritis is still unknown. research suggests that a person's genetic makeup is an important part of the picture, but not the whole story. some evidence shows that infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria, may trigger rheumatoid arthritis in people with an inherited tendency to develop the disease. however, a specific agent or agents are not yet known. not contagious it is important to note that rheumatoid arthritis is not contagious. a person cannot catch it from someone else.  learn more about the causes of rheumatoid arthritis."
what is (are) disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,"disseminated intravascular coagulation (ko-ag-u-la-shun), or dic, is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. these blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body's organs.
                
in dic, the increased clotting uses up platelets (plate-lets) and clotting factors in the blood. platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. clotting factors are proteins needed for normal blood clotting.
                
with fewer platelets and clotting factors in the blood, serious bleeding can occur. dic can cause internal and external bleeding.
                
internal bleeding occurs inside the body. external bleeding occurs underneath or from the skin or mucosa. (the mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.)
                
dic can cause life-threatening bleeding.
                
overview
                
to understand dic, it helps to understand the body's normal blood clotting process. your body has a system to control bleeding. when small cuts or breaks occur on blood vessel walls, your body activates clotting factors. these clotting factors, such as thrombin and fibrin, work with platelets to form blood clots.
                
blood clots seal the small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. after bleeding stops and the vessels heal, your body breaks down and removes the clots.
                
some diseases and conditions can cause clotting factors to become overactive, leading to dic. these diseases and conditions include:
                
sepsis (an infection in the bloodstream)
                
surgery and trauma
                
cancer
                
serious complications of pregnancy and childbirth
                
examples of less common causes of dic are bites from poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), frostbite, and burns.
                
the two types of dic are acute and chronic. acute dic develops quickly (over hours or days) and must be treated right away. the condition begins with excessive blood clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding.
                
chronic dic develops slowly (over weeks or months). it lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute dic. chronic dic causes excessive blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. cancer is the most common cause of chronic dic.
                
treatment for dic involves treating the clotting and bleeding problems and the underlying cause of the condition.
                
people who have acute dic may need blood transfusions, medicines, and other life-saving measures. people who have chronic dic may need medicines to help prevent blood clots from forming in their small blood vessels.
                
outlook
                
the outlook for dic depends on its severity and underlying cause. acute dic can damage the body's organs and even cause death if it's not treated right away. chronic dic also can damage the body's organs.
                
researchers are looking for ways to prevent dic or diagnose it early. they're also studying the use of various clotting proteins and medicines to treat the condition."

what are the genetic changes related to cap myopathy ?,"mutations in the acta1, tpm2, or tpm3 genes can cause cap myopathy. these genes provide instructions for producing proteins that play important roles in skeletal muscles.  the acta1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha ()-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). thin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction. attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract. the mutation in the acta1 gene that causes cap myopathy results in an abnormal protein that may interfere with the proper assembly of thin filaments. the cap structures in muscle cells characteristic of this disorder are composed of disorganized thin filaments.  the tpm2 and tpm3 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are members of the tropomyosin protein family. tropomyosin proteins regulate muscle contraction by attaching to actin and controlling its binding to myosin. the specific effects of tpm2 and tpm3 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin-myosin binding between the thin and thick filaments, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy."

what are the treatments for urinary incontinence in children ?,"most ui fades away naturally as a child grows and develops and does not require treatment. when treatment is needed, options include bladder training and related strategies, moisture alarms, and medications.
                
growth and development
                
as children mature
                
- bladder capacity increases  - natural body alarms become activated  - an overactive bladder settles down  - production of adh becomes normal  - response to the bodys signal that it is time to void improves
                
bladder training and related strategies
                
bladder training consists of exercises to strengthen the bladder muscles to better control urination. gradually lengthening the time between trips to the bathroom can also help by stretching the bladder so it can hold more urine. additional techniques that may help control daytime ui include
                
- urinating on a scheduletimed voidingsuch as every 2 hours  - avoiding food or drinks with caffeine  - following suggestions for healthy urination, such as relaxing muscles and taking enough time to allow the bladder to empty completely
                
waking children up to urinate can help decrease nighttime ui. ensuring children drink enough fluids throughout the day so they do not drink a lot of fluids close to bedtime may also help. a health care provider can give guidance about how much a child needs to drink each day, as the amount depends on a childs age, physical activity, and other factors.
                
moisture alarms
                
at night, moisture alarms can wake children when they begin to urinate. these devices use a water-sensitive pad connected to an alarm that sounds when moisture is first detected. a small pad can clip to the pajamas, or a larger pad can be placed on the bed. for the alarm to be effective, children must awaken as soon as the alarm goes off, stop the urine stream, and go to the bathroom. children using moisture alarms may need to have someone sleep in the same room to help wake them up.
                
medications
                
nighttime ui may be treated by increasing adh levels. the hormone can be boosted by a synthetic version known as desmopressin (ddavp), which is available in pill form, nasal spray, and nose drops. ddavp is approved for use in children. another medication, called imipramine (tofranil), is also used to treat nighttime ui, though the way this medication prevents bedwetting is not known. although both of these medications may help children achieve short-term success, relapse is common once the medication is withdrawn.
                
ui resulting from an overactive bladder may be treated with oxybutynin (ditropan), a medication that helps calm the bladder muscle and control muscle spasms."
what are the genetic changes related to aromatase deficiency ?,"mutations in the cyp19a1 gene cause aromatase deficiency. the cyp19a1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. this enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of estrogen. in females, estrogen guides female sexual development before birth and during puberty. in both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood sugar levels. during fetal development, aromatase converts androgens to estrogens in the placenta, which is the link between the mother's blood supply and the fetus. this conversion in the placenta prevents androgens from directing sexual development in female fetuses. after birth, the conversion of androgens to estrogens takes place in multiple tissues.  cyp19a1 gene mutations that cause aromatase deficiency decrease or eliminate aromatase activity. a shortage of functional aromatase results in an inability to convert androgens to estrogens before birth and throughout life. as a result, there is a decrease in estrogen production and an increase in the levels of androgens, including testosterone. in affected individuals, these abnormal hormone levels lead to impaired female sexual development, unusual bone growth, insulin resistance, and other signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency. in women who are pregnant with an affected fetus, excess androgens in the placenta pass into the woman's bloodstream, which may cause her to have temporary signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency."

what are the genetic changes related to fanconi anemia ?,"mutations in at least 15 genes can cause fanconi anemia. proteins produced from these genes are involved in a cell process known as the fa pathway. the fa pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of dna, called dna replication, is blocked due to dna damage. the fa pathway sends certain proteins to the area of damage, which trigger dna repair so dna replication can continue.  the fa pathway is particularly responsive to a certain type of dna damage known as interstrand cross-links (icls). icls occur when two dna building blocks (nucleotides) on opposite strands of dna are abnormally attached or linked together, which stops the process of dna replication. icls can be caused by a buildup of toxic substances produced in the body or by treatment with certain cancer therapy drugs.  eight proteins associated with fanconi anemia group together to form a complex known as the fa core complex. the fa core complex activates two proteins, called fancd2 and fanci. the activation of these two proteins brings dna repair proteins to the area of the icl so the cross-link can be removed and dna replication can continue.  eighty to 90 percent of cases of fanconi anemia are due to mutations in one of three genes, fanca, fancc, and fancg. these genes provide instructions for producing components of the fa core complex. mutations in any of the many genes associated with the fa core complex will cause the complex to be nonfunctional and disrupt the entire fa pathway. as a result, dna damage is not repaired efficiently and icls build up over time. the icls stall dna replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability make new dna molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of dna repair processes. cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. the death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of fanconi anemia. when the buildup of errors in dna leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop acute myeloid leukemia or other cancers."

what is (are) type a insulin resistance syndrome ?,"type a insulin resistance syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's tissues and organs do not respond properly to the hormone insulin. insulin normally helps regulate blood sugar levels by controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. in people with type a insulin resistance syndrome, insulin resistance impairs blood sugar regulation and ultimately leads to a condition called diabetes mellitus, in which blood sugar levels can become dangerously high.  severe insulin resistance also underlies the other signs and symptoms of type a insulin resistance syndrome. in affected females, the major features of the condition become apparent in adolescence. many affected females do not begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea) or their periods may be light and irregular (oligomenorrhea). they develop cysts on the ovaries and excessive body hair growth (hirsutism). most affected females also develop a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans, in which the skin in body folds and creases becomes thick, dark, and velvety. unlike most people with insulin resistance, females with type a insulin resistance syndrome are usually not overweight.  the features of type a insulin resistance syndrome are more subtle in affected males. some males have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) as the only sign; others may also have acanthosis nigricans. in many cases, males with this condition come to medical attention only when they develop diabetes mellitus in adulthood.  type a insulin resistance syndrome is one of a group of related conditions described as inherited severe insulin resistance syndromes. these disorders, which also include donohue syndrome and rabson-mendenhall syndrome, are considered part of a spectrum. type a insulin resistance syndrome represents the mildest end of the spectrum: its features often do not become apparent until puberty or later, and it is generally not life-threatening."

what are the treatments for national hormone and pituitary program (nhpp): information for people treated with pituitary human growth hormone (comprehensive report) ?,"most people were treated with pituitary hgh because their pituitary glands did not make enough of their own gh. some of these people also had problems making other pituitary hormones. one of these hormones tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol, a hormone needed for life. people lacking this hormone are at risk of death from adrenal crisis, but adrenal crisis can be prevented. more pituitary hgh recipients have died from adrenal crisis than from cjd. pituitary hgh did not cause adrenal problems, but some people who received hgh have a pituitary problem that puts them at risk for adrenal crisis. please read the health alert and discuss this information with your doctor.
                
besides cjd, no other serious or fatal health risks from pituitary hgh treatment have been found.
                
mad cow disease
                
starting in 1996, reports of a new form of cjd in young people who lived in the united kingdom have raised concerns worldwide.
                
since at least 1985, some cattle in the united kingdom have developed a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), or ""mad cow"" disease. ""mad cow"" disease is a sickness in cattle that is caused by an agent that is similar, but not identical, to the agents that cause the most common forms of cjd in people. individuals who consume products made from cattle infected with the agent that causes ""mad cow"" disease can become infected with the agent themselves and develop the human form of ""mad cow"" disease, called variant cjd (vcjd). in humans, vcjd and the more common forms of cjd (those without the word ""variant"") are separate diseases. as of november 2012, 227 cases of vcjd were confirmed worldwide, mostly from the united kingdom. researchers believe all but three of these 227 individuals got vcjd by eating beef from animals with ""mad cow"" disease. the three exceptions were persons who are believed to have developed vcjd because they received infected blood from a donor who had acquired the agent by eating beef from animals with ""mad cow"" disease.
                
in the united states, three cases of vcjd have been found. according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the investigation of these three cases indicated that they most likely acquired their infection in the united kingdom (two cases) and saudi arabia (one case).
                
people who received pituitary hgh are not at higher risk for vcjd.
                
aids
                
hiv, also known as the human immunodeficiency virus, causes aids. pituitary hgh does not cause aids. hiv is destroyed by the methods used to make pituitary hgh. people who have been treated with pituitary hgh do not have a higher risk for aids.
                
low levels of gh in adults
                
some people who received pituitary hgh as children may have low levels of gh as adults and might therefore benefit from bgh as adults. people with low levels of growth hormone as adults may have symptoms or changes like these:
                
- more body fat  - less muscle  - less bone mass  - less strength  - less energy
                
if you lacked gh as a child and have these problems as an adult, ask your doctor whether they might be due to low gh. because these conditions are common in many people, they are not always due to low gh. studies have shown that gh treatment in adults with low gh reduces fat and increases muscle mass. effects on strength, energy, and bone fractures in gh-deficient adults receiving gh replacement are not as clear.
                
today, gh is completely synthetic. it is not made from human pituitaries. it poses no threat of contamination. the human growth foundation (hgf) is one source of information about growth-related disorders. the foundation can be reached at 18004516434.
                
cancer
                
hhs studies of people treated with pituitary hgh supplied by the nhpp show no increased risk of cancer in those who did not have tumors before pituitary hgh treatment. many people who received nhpp pituitary hgh had brain tumors that caused their lack of gh. people who have had one tumor have an increased risk for getting other tumors.
                
in previous updates, we reported that in 1988, japanese doctors reported an increased risk of leukemia in people treated with gh. subsequent studies of individuals who were given pituitary hgh in the united states, japan, and the united kingdom found no higher rate of leukemia among those who did not have tumors and/or radiation before treatment with pituitary hgh.
                
emotional problems
                
no studies have shown that pituitary hgh causes changes in personality, emotional problems, or suicide."

what are the genetic changes related to laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?,"loc syndrome is caused by mutations in the lama3 gene, which provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called laminin 332. this protein is made up of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma. the lama3 gene carries instructions for the alpha subunit; the beta and gamma subunits are produced from other genes.  the laminin 332 protein plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin by helping to attach the top layer of skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. studies suggest that laminin 332 is also involved in wound healing. additionally, researchers have proposed roles for laminin 332 in the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea) and in the development of tooth enamel.  the mutations involved in loc syndrome alter the structure of one version of the alpha subunit of laminin 332 (called alpha-3a). laminins made with the altered subunit cannot effectively attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin or regulate wound healing. these abnormalities of laminin 332 cause the cutaneous erosions and overgrowth of granulation tissue that are characteristic of loc syndrome. the inability of laminin 332 to perform its other functions leads to the nail and tooth abnormalities that occur in this condition."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with oropharyngeal cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    patients with oropharyngeal cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer.
                    the patient's treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. because the oropharynx helps in breathing, eating, and talking, patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment. the medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals with special training in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. these may include the following specialists:         - head and neck surgeon.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  plastic surgeon.    -  dentist.    -  dietitian.    -  psychologist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.    -  speech therapist.
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery      surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment of all stages of oropharyngeal cancer. a surgeon may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around the cancer. even if the surgeon removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    new types of surgery, including transoral robotic surgery, are being studied for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. transoral robotic surgery may be used to remove cancer from hard-to-reach areas of the mouth and throat. cameras attached to a robot give a 3-dimensional (3d) image that a surgeon can see. using a computer, the surgeon guides very small tools at the ends of the robot arms to remove the cancer. this procedure may also be done using an endoscope.       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. these types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt): imrt is a type of 3-dimensional (3-d) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       -  stereotactic body radiation therapy: stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. by having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. this procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.                -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           in advanced oropharyngeal cancer, dividing the daily dose of radiation into smaller-dose treatments improves the way the tumor responds to treatment. this is called hyperfractionated radiation therapy.    the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat oropharyngeal cancer.    radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment.     if the thyroid or pituitary gland are part of the radiation treatment area, the patient has an increased risk of hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). a blood test to check the thyroid hormone level in the body should be done before and after treatment.       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. systemic chemotherapy is used to treat oropharyngeal cancer.    see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information. (oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. monoclonal antibodies are a type of targeted therapy being used in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer.    monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances in the blood or tissues that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     cetuximab is a type of monoclonal antibody that works by binding to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells and stops the cells from growing and dividing. it is used in the treatment of recurrent oropharyngeal cancer.    other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. nivolumab is being studied in the treatment of stage iii and iv oropharyngeal cancer.    see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information. (oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   following treatment, it is important to have careful head and neck exams to look for signs that the cancer has come back. check-ups will be done every 6 to 12 weeks in the first year, every 3 months in the second year, every 3 to 4 months in the third year, and every 6 months thereafter.

how many people are affected by smith-magenis syndrome ?,"smith-magenis syndrome affects at least 1 in 25,000 individuals worldwide. researchers believe that many people with this condition are not diagnosed, however, so the true prevalence may be closer to 1 in 15,000 individuals."
do you have information about infant and newborn care,"summary : going home with a new baby is exciting, but it can be scary, too. newborns have many needs, like frequent feedings and diaper changes. babies can have health issues that are different from older children and adults, like diaper rash and cradle cap.     your baby will go through many changes during the first year of life. you may feel uneasy at first. ask your health care provider for help if you need it."
what is (are) wolff-parkinson-white syndrome ?,"wolff-parkinson-white syndrome is a condition that disrupts the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). people with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome are born with a heart abnormality that affects the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart.  this abnormality leads to an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other arrhythmias. in most cases, the cause of wolff-parkinson-white syndrome is unknown. a small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in the prkag2 gene. these cases appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
what are the genetic changes related to weyers acrofacial dysostosis ?,"most cases of weyers acrofacial dysostosis result from mutations in the evc2 gene. a mutation in a similar gene, evc, has been found in at least one person with the characteristic features of the disorder. little is known about the function of the evc and evc2 genes, although they appear to play important roles in cell-to-cell signaling during development. in particular, the proteins produced from these genes are thought to help regulate the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. this pathway plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.  the mutations that cause weyers acrofacial dysostosis result in the production of an abnormal evc or evc2 protein. it is unclear how the abnormal proteins lead to the specific signs and symptoms of this condition. studies suggest that they interfere with sonic hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the formation and growth of the teeth, nails, and bones."

what to do for what i need to know about gestational diabetes ?,"- gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.  - gestational diabetes happens when your body can't make enough insulin during pregnancy. insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.  - you will probably be tested for gestational diabetes between weeks 24 and 28 of your pregnancy. if you have a higher chance of getting gestational diabetes, your doctor may test you for diabetes during your first visit after you become pregnant.  - if you have high blood glucose levels because your gestational diabetes is not under control, your baby will also have high blood glucose.  - untreated or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can cause problems for your baby.  - treating gestational diabetes means taking steps to keep your blood glucose levels in a target range.  - even if your blood glucose levels return to normal after your pregnancy, your chances of getting diabetesusually type 2 diabeteslater in life are high. therefore, you should be tested at least every 3 years for diabetes or prediabetes.  - you can give your baby a healthy start by breastfeeding.  - you can help your child be healthy by showing your child how to make healthy lifestyle choices, including being physically active, limiting screen time in front of the tv or video games, eating a healthy diet, and staying at a healthy weight."
is boomerang dysplasia inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. almost all cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
how to diagnose hematuria (blood in the urine) ?,"hematuria is diagnosed with urinalysis, which is testing of a urine sample. the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. for the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. patches on the dipstick change color when rbcs are present in urine. when blood is visible in the urine or a dipstick test of the urine indicates the presence of rbcs, a health care provider examines the urine with a microscope to make an initial diagnosis of hematuria. the next step is to diagnose the cause of the hematuria.
                
the health care provider will take a thorough medical history. if the history suggests a cause that does not require treatment, the urine should be tested again after 48 hours for the presence of rbcs. if two of three urine samples show too many rbcs when viewed with a microscope, more serious causes should be explored. the health care provider may order one or more of the following tests:
                
- urinalysis. further testing of the urine may be done to check for problems that can cause hematuria, such as infection, kidney disease, and cancer. the presence of white blood cells signals a uti. rbcs that are misshapen or clumped together to form little tubes, called casts, may indicate kidney disease. large amounts of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, may also indicate kidney disease. the urine can also be tested for the presence of cancer cells.  - blood test. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. a blood test can show the presence of high levels of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown, which may indicate kidney disease.  - biopsy. a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. the biopsyis performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. the health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography (ct) scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney. the kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. the test helps diagnose the type of kidney disease causing hematuria.  - cystoscopy. cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument to look inside the urethra and bladder. cystoscopy is performed by a health care provider in the office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital with local anesthesia. however, in some cases, sedation and regional or general anesthesia are needed. cystoscopy may be used to look for cancer cells in the bladder, particularly if cancer cells are found with urinalysis. more information is provided in the niddk health topic,cystoscopy and ureteroscopy.   - kidney imaging tests. intravenous pyelogram (ivp) is an x ray of the urinary tract. a special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. the contrast medium also shows any blockage in the urinary tract. when a small mass is found with ivp, another imaging test, such as an ultrasound, ct scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (mri), can be used to further study the mass. imaging tests are performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. anesthesia is not needed, though light sedation may be used in some cases. imaging tests may show a tumor, a kidney or bladder stone, an enlarged prostate, or other blockage of the normal flow of urine. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, imaging of the urinary tract."

who is at risk for stroke? ?,"certain traits, conditions, and habits can raise your risk of having a stroke or transient ischemic attack (tia). these traits, conditions, and habits are known as risk factors.
                
the more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to have a stroke. you can treat or control some risk factors, such as high blood pressure and smoking. other risk factors, such as age and gender, you cant control.
                
the major risk factors for stroke include:
                
high blood pressure. high blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke. blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) over time. if you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmhg or higher.
                
diabetes. diabetes is a disease in which the blood sugar level is high because the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy.
                
heart diseases.coronary heart disease,cardiomyopathy,heart failure, andatrial fibrillationcan cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke.
                
smoking. smoking can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure. smoking also may reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches your bodys tissues. exposure to secondhand smoke also can damage the blood vessels.
                
age and gender. your risk of stroke increases as you get older. at younger ages, men are more likely than women to have strokes. however, women are more likely to die from strokes. women who take birth control pills also are at slightly higher risk of stroke.
                
race and ethnicity. strokes occur more often in african american, alaska native, and american indian adults than in white, hispanic, or asian american adults.
                
personal or family history of stroke or tia. if youve had a stroke, youre at higher risk for another one. your risk of having a repeat stroke is the highest right after a stroke. a tia also increases your risk of having a stroke, as does having a family history of stroke.
                
brainaneurysmsor arteriovenous malformations (avms). aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. avms are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture (break open) within the brain. avms may be present at birth, but often arent diagnosed until they rupture.
                
other risk factors for stroke, many of which of you can control, include:
                
alcohol and illegal drug use, including cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs
                
certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), and bleeding disorders
                
lack of physical activity
                
overweight and obesity
                
stress and depression
                
unhealthy cholesterol levels
                
unhealthy diet
                
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), but not aspirin, may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly in patients who have had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery. the risk may increase the longer nsaids are used. common nsaids include ibuprofen and naproxen.
                
following a healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of stroke. some people also may need to take medicines to lower their risk. sometimes strokes can occur in people who dont have any known risk factors."

what is (are) vulvar cancer ?,"key points
                    - vulvar cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the vulva.    - having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or hpv infection can affect the risk of vulvar cancer.    - signs of vulvar cancer include bleeding or itching.    - tests that examine the vulva are used to detect (find) and diagnose vulvar cancer.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    vulvar cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the vulva.
                    vulvar cancer forms in a woman's external genitalia. the vulva includes:         - inner and outer lips of the vagina.    - clitoris (sensitive tissue between the lips).     - opening of the vagina and its glands.    - mons pubis (the rounded area in front of the pubic bones that becomes covered with hair at puberty).    -  perineum (the area between the vulva and the anus).         vulvar cancer most often affects the outer vaginal lips. less often, cancer affects the inner vaginal lips, clitoris, or vaginal glands.    vulvar cancer usually forms slowly over a number of years. abnormal cells can grow on the surface of the vulvar skin for a long time. this condition is called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin). because it is possible for vin to become vulvar cancer, it is very important to get treatment.
                
                
                    having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or hpv infection can affect the risk of vulvar cancer.
                    anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for vulvar cancer include the following:         - having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin).    - having human papillomavirus (hpv) infection.    - having a history of genital warts.        other possible risk factors include the following:         - having many sexual partners.    - having first sexual intercourse at a young age.    - having a history of abnormal pap tests (pap smears).
                          
                
							            recurrent vulvar cancer
							            recurrent vulvar cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. the cancer may come back in the vulva or in other parts of the body."
is paget disease of bone inherited ?,"in 15 to 40 percent of all cases of classic paget disease of bone, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means that having one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  in the remaining cases, the inheritance pattern of classic paget disease of bone is unclear. many affected people have no family history of the disease, although it sometimes clusters in families. studies suggest that close relatives of people with classic paget disease of bone are 7 to 10 times more likely to develop the disease than people without an affected relative.  early-onset paget disease of bone is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. in people with this form of the disorder, having one altered copy of the tnfrsf11a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disease."
what is (are) pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta ?,"pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (pleva) is the acute form of a skin condition called pityriasis lichenoides. affected people generally develop a few to more than one hundred scaling papules which may become filled with blood and/or pus or erode into crusted red-brown spots. pleva generally resolves on its own within a few weeks to a few months; however, some people experience episodes of the condition on and off for years. although pleva is diagnosed in people of all ages, it most commonly affects children and young adults. the exact underlying cause is unknown, but some scientists suspect that it may occur due to an exaggerated immune response or an overproduction of certain white blood cells (lymphoproliferative disorder). if treatment is necessary, recommended therapies may include oral antibiotic, sun exposure, topical steroids, immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize the immune system), phototherapy and/or systemic steroids."
what is (are) creating a family health history ?,talk to other family members. you can also obtain a death certificate from a state or county vital statistics office to confirm a late relative's cause of death. funeral homes and online obituaries may also have this information.
what is (are) short bowel syndrome ?,"intestinal adaptation is a process that usually occurs in children after removal of a large portion of their small intestine. the remaining small intestine goes through a period of adaptation and grows to increase its ability to absorb nutrients. intestinal adaptation can take up to 2 years to occur, and during this time a person may be heavily dependent on parenteral or enteral nutrition.1"
what is (are) ards ?,"ards, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ards can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.
                
people who develop ards often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. they might already be in the hospital when they develop ards.
                
overview
                
to understand ards, it helps to understand how the lungs work. when you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. the air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. these sacs are called alveoli (al-vee-uhl-eye).
                
small blood vessels called capillaries (kap-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.
                
in ards, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause fluid to build up in the air sacs. this prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.
                
as a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.
                
people who develop ards often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ards, such as severe pneumonia.
                
if you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. if you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.
                
outlook
                
more people are surviving ards now than in the past. one likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. survival rates for ards vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ards, associated illnesses, and other factors.
                
some people who survive recover completely. others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.

what are the genetic changes related to x-linked sideroblastic anemia ?,"mutations in the alas2 gene cause x-linked sideroblastic anemia. the alas2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called erythroid ala-synthase, which plays a critical role in the production of heme (a component of the hemoglobin protein) in bone marrow.  alas2 mutations impair the activity of erythroid ala-synthase, which disrupts normal heme production and prevents erythroblasts from making enough hemoglobin. because almost all of the iron transported into erythroblasts is normally incorporated into heme, the reduced production of heme leads to a buildup of excess iron in these cells. additionally, the body attempts to compensate for the hemoglobin shortage by absorbing more iron from the diet. this buildup of excess iron damages the body's organs. low hemoglobin levels and the resulting accumulation of iron in the body's organs lead to the characteristic features of x-linked sideroblastic anemia.  people who have a mutation in another gene, hfe, along with a mutation in the alas2 gene may experience a more severe form of x-linked sideroblastic anemia. in this uncommon situation, the combined effect of these two mutations can lead to a more serious iron overload. mutations in the hfe gene alone can increase the absorption of iron from the diet and result in hemochromatosis, which is another type of iron overload disorder."
what is (are) paget's disease of bone ?,"enlarged and misshapen bones paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. in paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. the new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. it may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones. complications paget's disease can also lead to complications, such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, or nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. if not treated, paget's disease can reduce a person's ability to perform activities of daily living, thereby reducing quality of life. although it is the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, paget's disease is still uncommon. according to bone health and osteoporosis: a report of the surgeon general, an estimated 1 million people in the u.s. have paget's disease, or about 1.3 people per 100 men and women age 45-74. the disease is more common in older people and those of northern european heritage. men are more likely than women to have the disease. cause is unknown paget's disease is named after the british surgeon, sir james paget, who first identified the disease in 1877. researchers are not sure what causes it. heredity may be a factor in some cases. research suggests that a close relative of someone with paget's disease is seven times more likely to develop the disease than someone without an affected relative. however, most people with paget's disease do not have any relatives with the disease. researchers think the disease also may be caused by other factors, such as a slow-acting virus. a treatable disease the good news is that paget's disease of bone is treatable, especially if it is diagnosed early. in recent years, the food and drug administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow the disease's progression. in some cases, surgery can help patients manage the symptoms and complications of the disease."
what is (are) meningoencephalocele ?,"meningoencephalocele is a type of encephalocele, which is an abnormal sac of fluid, brain tissue, and meninges (membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord) that extends through a defect in the skull.  there are two main types of meningoencephalocele, which are named according to the location of the sac. the frontoethmoidal type is located at the frontal and ethmoid bones while the occipital type is located at the occipital bone.  hydrocephalus, abnormalities of the eyeball and tear duct, and other findings have been associated with the condition. some affected individuals have intellectual or physical disabilities while others have normal development and abilities.  the condition is typically congenital (present at birth) but has been reported to develop by chance in older individuals in rare cases. the underlying cause of the condition is uncertain, but environmental factors are thought to play a role. treatment depends on the size, location and severity of the defect but mainly includes magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to determine the severity of the defect, followed by surgery to repair it."
is pyruvate kinase deficiency inherited ?,"how is pyruvate kinase deficiency inherited? pyruvate kinase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that a child must inherit a gene with a disease-causing mutation from both parents to develop the disorder. the gene that causes pyruvate kinase deficiency is called the pklr gene that is located on chromosome 1q21.  although the inheritance is clinically autosomal recessive, most affected individuals are compound heterozygous for two different mutant alleles. it is estimated that approximatly 1 in 100 people carry one copy of a disease-causing mutation in the pklr gene.  carriers of one non-working pklr gene usually have moderatly reduced levels of pyruvate kinase activity but do not develop clinical symptoms. it is possible that carriers of a mutant pyruvate kinase genemay have a protective advantage against malaria in areas where the disease is endemic."
what to do for irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"- irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a functional gastrointestinal (gi) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the gi tract works. children with a functional gi disorder have frequent symptoms, but the gi tract does not become damaged.  - ibs is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together.  - the most common symptoms of ibs are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both.  - the causes of ibs are not well understood. the possible causes of ibs in children include brain-gut signal problems, gi motor problems, hypersensitivity, mental health problems, bacterial gastroenteritis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and genetics.  - to diagnose ibs, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. the medical history will include questions about the childs symptoms, family members with gi disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. ibs is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the childs symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:      - has had symptoms at least once per week for at least 2 months    - is growing as expected    - is not showing any signs that suggest another cause for the symptoms    - though there is no cure for ibs, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:      - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition    - medications    - probiotics    - therapies for mental health problems"

how to diagnose klinefelter syndrome ?,how is klinefelter syndrome diagnosed? a diagnosis of klinefelter syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. this generally includes a chromosomal analysis (called a karyotype). it is also possible to diagnosis klinefelter syndrome before birth through chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis.
is mecp2 duplication syndrome inherited ?,"mecp2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an x-linked pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a duplication of the only copy of the mecp2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder. females usually do not have signs and symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome because the x chromosome that contains the duplication may be turned off (inactive) due to a process called x-inactivation.  early in embryonic development in females, one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). x-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell. usually x-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each x chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. sometimes x-inactivation is not random, and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells. when x-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed x-inactivation.  research shows that females with an mecp2 gene duplication have skewed x-inactivation, which results in the inactivation of the x chromosome containing the duplication in most cells of the body. this skewed x inactivation ensures that only the chromosome with the normal mecp2 gene is expressed. this skewed x-inactivation is why females with an mecp2 gene duplication typically do not have any features related to the additional genetic material."
what is (are) orofaciodigital syndrome 2 ?,"orofaciodigital syndrome (ofds) type 2 is a genetic condition that was first described in 1941 by mohr. ofds type 2 belongs to a group of disorders called orofaciodigital syndromes (ofds) characterized by mouth malformations, unique facial findings, and abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes. other organs might be affected in ofds, defining the specific types. ofds type 2 is very similar to oral-facial-digital syndrome (ofds) type 1. however, the following are not found in ofds type 1: (1) absence of hair and skin abnormalities; (2) presence of more than one fused big toe on each foot; (3) involvement of the central nervous system; and (4) heart malformations. although it is known that ofds type 2 is genetic, the exact gene that causes the syndrome has not been identified. the condition is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. treatment is based on the symptoms present in the patient."
what are the treatments for binswanger's disease ?,"how is binswanger's disease treated? the brain damage associated with binswanger's disease is not reversible. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. for example, medications may be prescribed to treat depression, agitation, and other symptoms associated with the condition. successful management of hypertension and diabetes can slow the progression of atherosclerosis, which can delay the progression of binswanger's disease."
is focal dermal hypoplasia inherited ?,"focal dermal hypoplasia is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. the x chromosome that contains the mutated porcn gene may be turned on (active) or turned off (inactive) due to a process called x-inactivation. early in embryonic development in females, one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). x-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell. usually x-inactivation occurs randomly, so that each x chromosome is active in about half the body's cells. sometimes x-inactivation is not random, and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells. when x-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed x-inactivation. researchers suspect that the distribution of active and inactive x chromosomes may play a role in determining the severity of focal dermal hypoplasia in females.  in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the porcn gene in each cell appears to be lethal very early in development. a male can be born with focal dermal hypoplasia if he has a porcn gene mutation in only some of his cells (known as mosaicism). affected males typically experience milder symptoms of the disorder than females because more of their cells have a functional copy of the porcn gene. a characteristic of focal dermal hypoplasia is that mildly affected fathers cannot pass this condition to their sons, but they can pass it to their daughters, who are usually more severely affected than they are. women with focal dermal hypoplasia cannot pass this condition to their sons (because it is lethal early in development) but can pass it to their daughters.  most cases of focal dermal hypoplasia in females result from new mutations in the porcn gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. when focal dermal hypoplasia occurs in males, it always results from a new mutation in this gene that is not inherited. only about 5 percent of females with this condition inherit a mutation in the porcn gene from a parent."
is mabry syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) prevent diabetes problems: keep your kidneys healthy ?,"your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. they are located just below your rib cage, one on each side of your spine. every day, your two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. urine flows from your kidneys to your bladder through tubes called ureters. your bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination."
is spinal muscular atrophy inherited ?,"types i, ii, iii, and iv spinal muscular atrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the smn1 gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. extra copies of the smn2 gene are due to a random error when making new copies of dna (replication) in an egg or sperm cell or just after fertilization.  sma-led and the late-onset form of spinal muscular atrophy caused by vapb gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  x-linked spinal muscular atrophy is inherited in an x-linked pattern. the uba1 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
what causes brittle diabetes ?,"what causes brittle diabetes? there are multiple causes of brittle diabetes. emotional stress seems to play an important role, in some cases leading to hormonal inbalances which can lead to brittle diabetes. emotional stress can also lead to a shift in the behavior of an individual, leading them to neglect their self-care. other cases can be traced to physiological causes, including malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying due to autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis), celiac disease, impaired glucose counterregulation (which doesn't allow the patient's body to react as it should when blood glucose levels drop), hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, drug or alcohol use, systemic insulin resistance, and abnormal insulin absorption or degradation."
what are the symptoms of wernicke-korsakoff syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of wernicke-korsakoff syndrome? the symptoms of wernicke encephalopathy include mental confusion, vision problems (including double vision, abnormal eye movements, and eyelid drooping), inability to think clearly, coma, hypothermia, hypotension, and loss of muscle coordination (ataxia). the symptoms of korsakoff's amnesia include loss of memory, inability to form new memories, making of stories (confabulation), seeing or hearing things that are not really there (hallucinations), disorientation, and vision impairment. the main features of korsakoff's amnesic syndrome are impairments in acquiring new information or establishing new memories, and in retrieving previous memories. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for wernicke-korsakoff syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) ataxia - autosomal recessive inheritance - coma - confusion - horizontal nystagmus - memory impairment - ophthalmoplegia - polyneuropathy - psychosis - ptosis - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) 9q22.3 microdeletion ?,"9q22.3 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 9 is deleted in each cell. the deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome in a region designated q22.3. this chromosomal change is associated with delayed development, intellectual disability, certain physical abnormalities, and the characteristic features of a genetic condition called gorlin syndrome.  many individuals with a 9q22.3 microdeletion have delayed development, particularly affecting the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. in some people, the delays are temporary and improve in childhood. more severely affected individuals have permanent developmental disabilities along with intellectual impairment and learning problems. rarely, seizures have been reported in people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion.  about 20 percent of people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion experience overgrowth (macrosomia), which results in increased height and weight compared to unaffected peers. the macrosomia often begins before birth and continues into childhood. other physical changes that can be associated with a 9q22.3 microdeletion include the premature fusion of certain bones in the skull (metopic craniosynostosis) and a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features such as a prominent forehead with vertical skin creases, upward- or downward-slanting eyes, a short nose, and a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum).  9q22.3 microdeletions also cause the characteristic features of gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome). this genetic condition affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. in people with gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of skin cancer. most people with this condition also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors, which can cause facial swelling and tooth displacement. other types of tumors that occur more often in people with gorlin syndrome include a form of childhood brain cancer called a medulloblastoma and a type of benign tumor called a fibroma that occurs in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. other features of gorlin syndrome include small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull."

what is (are) prader-willi syndrome ?,"prader-willi syndrome (pws) is a rare genetic disorder. it causes poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones and a constant feeling of hunger. the part of the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly in people with pws. they overeat, leading to obesity.    babies with pws are usually floppy, with poor muscle tone, and have trouble sucking. boys may have undescended testicles. later, other signs appear. these include       - short stature    - poor motor skills    - weight gain     - underdeveloped sex organs    - mild intellectual and learning disabilities       there is no cure for pws. growth hormone, exercise, and dietary supervision can help build muscle mass and control weight. other treatments may include sex hormones and behavior therapy. most people with pws will need specialized care and supervision throughout their lives.    nih: national institute of child health and human development"
what is (are) celiac disease ?,"celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. the classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. this inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. in celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. these health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. this form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. on average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. however, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. they also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  in a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called t-cell lymphoma."
what are the treatments for sickle cell disease ?,"health maintenance to prevent complications
                
babies with sickle cell disease (scd) should be referred to a doctor or provider group that has experience taking care of people with this disease. the doctor might be a hematologist (a doctor with special training in blood diseases) or an experienced general pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner.
                
for infants, the first scd visit should take place before 8 weeks of age.
                
if someone was born in a country that doesnt perform newborn scd screening, he or she might be diagnosed with scd later in childhood. these people should also be referred as soon as possible for special scd care.
                

                

                
examining the person
                
giving medicines and immunizations
                
performing tests
                
educating families about the disease and what to watch out for
                

                
preventing infection
                
in scd, the spleen doesnt work properly or doesnt work at all. this problem makes people with scd more likely to get severe infections.
                
penicillin
                
in children with scd, taking penicillin two times a day has been shown to reduce the chance of having a severe infection caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. infants need to take liquid penicillin. older children can take tablets.
                
many doctors will stop prescribing penicillin after a child has reached the age of 5. some prefer to continue this antibiotic throughout life, particularly if a person has hemoglobin ss or hemoglobin s0 thalassemia, since people with scd are still at risk. all people who have had surgical removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, or a past infection with pneumococcus should keep taking penicillin throughout life.
                
immunizations
                
people with scd should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. they should also receive additional vaccines to prevent other infections.
                
pneumococcus. even though all children routinely receive the vaccine against pneumococcus (pcv13), children with scd should also receive a second kind of vaccine against pneumococcus (ppsv23). this second vaccine is given after 24 months of age and again 5 years later. adults with scd who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine should get a dose of the pcv13 vaccine. they should later receive the ppsv23 if they have not already received it or it has been more than 5 years since they did. a person should follow these guidelines even if he or she is still taking penicillin.
                
influenza. all people with scd should receive an influenza shot every year at the start of flu season. this should begin at 6 months of age. only the inactivated vaccine, which comes as a shot, should be used in people with scd.
                
meningococcus. a child with scd should receive this vaccine (menactra or menveo) at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age. the child should receive a booster vaccine 3 years after this series of shots, then every 5 years after that.
                
screening tests and evaluations
                
height, weight, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation
                
doctors will monitor height and weight to be sure that a child is growing properly and that a person with scd is maintaining a healthy weight.
                
doctors will also track a persons blood pressure. when a person with scd has high blood pressure, it needs to be treated promptly because it can increase the risk of stroke.
                
oxygen saturation testing provides information about how much oxygen the blood is carrying.
                
blood and urine testing
                
people with scd need to have frequent lab tests.
                
blood tests help to establish a persons baseline for problems like anemia. blood testing also helps to show whether a person has organ damage, so that it can be treated early.
                
urine testing can help to detect early kidney problems or infections.
                
transcranial doppler (tcd) ultrasound screening
                
children who have hemoglobin ss or hemoglobin s0 thalassemia and are between the ages of 2 and 16 should have tcd testing once a year.
                
this study can find out whether a child is at higher risk for stroke. when the test is abnormal, regular blood transfusions can decrease the chances of having a stroke.
                
the child is awake during the tcd exam. the test does not hurt at all. the tcd machine uses sound waves to measure blood flow like the ultrasound machine used to examine pregnant women.
                
eye examinations
                
an eye doctor, or ophthalmologist, should examine a persons eyes every 12 years from the age of 10 onwards.
                
these exams can detect if there are scd-related problems of the eye. regular exams can help doctors find and treat problems early to prevent loss of vision. a person should see his or her doctor right away for any sudden change in vision.
                
pulmonary hypertension
                
doctors have different approaches to screening for pulmonary hypertension. this is because studies have not given clear information as to when and how a person should receive the screening. people with scd and their caretakers should discuss with their doctor whether screening makes sense for them.
                
cognitive screening
                
people with sickle cell disease can develop cognitive (thinking) problems that may be hard to notice early in life.
                
sometimes these problems are caused by silent strokes that can only be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain.
                
people with scd should tell their doctors or nurses if they have thinking problems, such as difficulties learning in school, slowed decision making, or trouble organizing their thoughts.
                
people can be referred for cognitive testing. this testing can identify areas in which a person could use extra help.
                
children with scd who have thinking problems may qualify for an individualized education program, or iep. an iep is a plan that helps students to reach their educational goals. adults may be able to enroll in vocational rehabilitation programs that can help them with job training.
                
education and guidance
                
doctors and other providers will talk with people who have scd and their caretakers about complications and also review information at every visit.
                
because there are a lot of things to discuss, new topics are often introduced as a child or adult reaches an age when that subject is important to know about.
                
doctors and nurses know that there is a lot of information to learn, and they dont expect people to know everything after one discussion. people with scd and their families should not be afraid to ask questions.
                
topics that are usually covered include:
                
hours that medical staff are available and contact information to use when people with scd or caretakers have questions
                
a plan for what to do and where to get care if a person has a fever, pain, or other signs of scd complications that need immediate attention
                
how scd is inherited and the risk of having a child with scd
                
the importance of regular medical visits, screening tests, and evaluations
                
how to recognize and manage pain
                
how to palpate (feel) a childs spleen. because of the risk of splenic sequestration crisis, caretakers should learn how to palpate a childs spleen. they should try to feel for the spleen daily and more frequently when the child is ill. if they feel that the spleen is bigger than usual, they should call the care provider. 
                
transitioning care
                
when children with scd become adolescents or young adults, they often need to transition from a pediatric care team to an adult care team. this period has been shown to be associated with increased hospital admissions and medical problems. there seem to be many reasons for this.
                
some of the increased risk is directly related to the disease. as people with scd get older, they often develop more organ damage and more disabilities.
                
the shift in care usually occurs at the same time that adolescents are undergoing many changes in their emotional, social, and academic lives. the transition to more independent self-management may be difficult, and following treatment plans may become less likely.
                
when compared with pediatrics, there are often fewer adult scd programs available in a given region. this makes it more difficult for a person with scd to find appropriate doctors, particularly those with whom they feel comfortable.
                
to improve use of regular medical care by people with scd and to reduce age-related complications, many scd teams have developed special programs that the make transition easier. such programs should involve the pediatric and the adult care teams. they should also start early and continue over several years.
                
managing some complications of scd
                
acute pain
                
each person with scd should have a home treatment regimen that is best suited to their needs. the providers on the scd team usually help a person develop a written, tailored care plan. if possible, the person with scd should carry this plan with them when they go to the emergency room.
                
when an acute crisis is just starting, most doctors will advise the person to drink lots of fluids and to take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (nsaid) pain medication, such as ibuprofen. when a person has kidney problems, acetaminophen is often preferred.
                
if pain persists, many people will find that they need a stronger medicine.
                
combining additional interventions, such as massage, relaxation methods, or a heating pad, may also help.
                
if a person with scd cannot control the pain at home, he or she should go to an scd day hospital/outpatient unit or an emergency room to receive additional, stronger medicines and intravenous (iv) fluids.
                
some people may be able to return home once their pain is under better control. in this case, the doctor may prescribe additional pain medicines for a short course of therapy.
                
people often need to be admitted to the hospital to fully control an acute pain crisis.
                
when taken daily, hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of pain episodes.
                
chronic pain
                
sometimes chronic pain results from a complication, such as a leg ulcer or aseptic necrosis of the hip. in this case, doctors try to treat the complication causing the pain.
                
while chronic pain is common in adults with scd, the cause is often poorly understood. taking pain medicines daily may help to decrease the pain. some examples of these medicines include:
                
nsaid drugs, such as ibuprofen
                
duloxetine
                
gabapentin
                
amitriptyline
                
strong pain medicines, such as opiates
                
other approaches, such as massage, heat, or acupuncture may be helpful in some cases. chronic pain often comes with feelings of depression and anxiety. supportive counseling and, sometimes, antidepressant medicines may help. (see coping and emotional issues.)
                
severe anemia
                
people should see their doctors or go to a hospital right away if they develop anemia symptoms from a splenic sequestration crisis or an aplastic crisis. these conditions can be life-threatening, and the person will need careful monitoring and treatment in the hospital. a person also usually needs a blood transfusion.
                
people with scd and symptoms of severe anemia from other causes should also see a doctor right away.
                
infections
                
fever is a medical emergency in scd. all caretakers of infants and children with scd should take their child to their doctor or go to a hospital right away when their child has a fever. adults with scd should also seek care for fever or other signs of infection.
                
all children and adults who have scd and a fever (over 38.50 c or 101.30 f) must be seen by a doctor and treated with antibiotics right away.
                
some people will need to be hospitalized, while others may receive care and follow-up as an outpatient.
                
acute chest syndrome
                
people with scd and symptoms of acute chest syndrome should see their doctor or go to a hospital right away.
                
they will need to be admitted to the hospital where they should receive antibiotics and close monitoring. they may need oxygen therapy and a blood transfusion.
                
when taken daily, the medicine hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of acute chest events.
                
clinical stroke
                
people with scd who have symptoms of stroke should be brought to the hospital right away by an ambulance. if a person is having symptoms of stroke, someone should call 9-1-1.
                
symptoms of stroke may include:
                
weakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body
                
trouble speaking, walking, or understanding
                
loss of balance
                
severe headache
                
if imaging studies reveal that the person has had an acute stroke, he or she may need an exchange transfusion. this procedure involves slowly removing an amount of the persons blood and replacing it with blood from a donor who does not have scd or sickle cell trait. afterward, the person may need to receive monthly transfusions or other treatments to help to prevent another stroke.
                
silent stroke and cognitive problems
                
children and adults with scd and cognitive problems may be able to get useful help based upon the results of their testing. for instance, children may qualify for an iep. adults may be able to enroll in vocational, or job, training programs.
                
priapism
                
sometimes, a person may be able to relieve priapism by:
                
emptying the bladder by urinating
                
taking medicine
                
increasing fluid intake
                
doing light exercise
                
if a person has an episode that lasts for 4 hours or more, he should go to the hospital to see a hematologist and urologist.
                
pregnancy
                
pregnant women with scd are at greater risk for problems. they should always see an obstetrician, or ob, who has experience with scd and high-risk pregnancies and deliveries.
                
the obstetrician should work with a hematologist or primary medical doctor who is well informed about scd and its complications.
                
pregnant women with scd need more frequent medical visits so that their doctors can follow them closely. the doctor may prescribe certain vitamins and will be careful to prescribe pain medicines that are safe for the baby.
                
a pregnant woman with scd may need to have one or more blood transfusions during her pregnancy to treat complications, such as worsening anemia or an increased number of pain or acute chest syndrome events.
                
hydroxyurea
                
what is hydroxyurea?
                
hydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several scd complications.
                
this medicine was studied in patients with scd because it was known to increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin f) in the blood. increased hemoglobin f provides some protection against the effects of hemoglobin s.
                
hydroxyurea was later found to have several other benefits for a person with scd, such as decreasing inflammation.
                
use in adults. many studies of adults with hemoglobin ss or hemoglobin s thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. it also improved anemia and decreased the need for transfusions and hospital admissions.
                
use in children. studies in children with severe hemoglobin ss or s thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. a study of very young children (between the ages of 9 and 18 months) with hemoglobin ss or hemoglobin s thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea decreased the number of episodes of pain and dactylitis.
                
who should use hydroxyurea?
                
since hydroxyurea can decrease several complications of scd, most experts recommend that children and adults with hemoglobin ss or s0 thalassemia who have frequent painful episodes, recurrent chest crises, or severe anemia take hydroxyurea daily.
                
some experts offer hydroxyurea to all infants over 9 months of age and young children with hemoglobin ss or s0 thalassemia, even if they do not have severe clinical problems, to prevent or reduce the chance of complications. there is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months of age.
                
some experts will prescribe hydroxyurea to people with other types of scd who have severe, recurrent pain. there is little information available about how effective hydroxyurea is for these types of scd.
                
in all situations, people with scd should discuss with their doctors whether or not hydroxyurea is an appropriate medication for them.
                
pregnant women should not use hydroxyurea.
                
how is hydroxyurea taken?
                
to work properly, hydroxyurea should be taken by mouth daily at the prescribed dose. when a person does not take it regularly, it will not work as well, or it wont work at all.
                
a person with scd who is taking hydroxyurea needs careful monitoring. this is particularly true in the early weeks of taking the medicine. monitoring includes regular blood testing and dose adjustments.
                
what are the risks of hydroxyurea?
                
hydroxyurea can cause the bloods white cell count or platelet count to drop. in rare cases, it can worsen anemia. these side effects usually go away quickly if a person stops taking the medication. when a person restarts it, a doctor usually prescribes a lower dose.
                
other short-term side effects are less common.
                
it is still unclear whether hydroxyurea can cause problems later in life in people with scd who take it for many years. studies so far suggest that it does not put people at a higher risk of cancer and does not affect growth in children. but further studies are needed.
                
red blood cell transfusions
                
doctors may use acute and chronic red blood cell transfusions to treat and prevent certain scd complications. the red blood cells in a transfusion have normal hemoglobin in them.
                
a transfusion helps to raise the number of red blood cells and provides normal red blood cells that are more flexible than red blood cells with sickle hemoglobin. these cells live longer in the circulation. red blood cell transfusions decrease vaso-occlusion (blockage in the blood vessel) and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs.
                
acute transfusion in scd
                
doctors use blood transfusions in scd for complications that cause severe anemia. they may also use them when a person has an acute stroke, in many cases of acute chest crises, and in multi-organ failure.
                
a person with scd usually receives blood transfusions before surgery to prevent scd-related complications afterwards.
                
chronic transfusion
                
doctors recommend regular or ongoing blood transfusions for people who have had an acute stroke, since transfusions decrease the chances of having another stroke.
                
doctors also recommend chronic blood transfusions for children who have abnormal tcd ultrasound results because transfusions can reduce the chance of having a first stroke.
                
some doctors use this approach to treat complications that do not improve with hydroxyurea. they may also use transfusions in people who have too many side effects from hydroxyurea.
                
what are the risks of transfusion therapy?
                
possible complications include:
                
hemolysis
                
iron overload, particularly in people receiving chronic transfusions (can severely impair heart and lung function)
                
infection
                
alloimmunization (can make it hard to find a matching unit of blood for a future transfusion)
                
all blood banks and hospital personnel have adopted practices to reduce the risk of transfusion problems.
                
people with scd who receive transfusions should be monitored for and immunized against hepatitis. they should also receive regular screenings for iron overload. if a person has iron overload, the doctor will give chelation therapy, a medicine to reduce the amount of iron in the body and the problems that iron overload causes.
                

                
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
                
at the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) is the only cure for scd. people with scd and their families should ask their doctor about this procedure.
                
what are stem cells?
                
stem cells are special cells that can divide over and over again. after they divide, these cells can go on to become blood red cells, white cells, or platelets.
                
a person with scd has stem cells that make red blood cells that can sickle. people without scd have stem cells that make red cells that usually wont sickle.
                
what stem cells are used in hsct?
                
in hsct, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood of a person who does not have sickle cell disease (the donor). the donor, however, may have sickle cell trait.
                
the donor is often the persons sister or brother. this is because the safest and most successful transplants use stem cells that are matched for special proteins called hla antigens. since these antigens are inherited from parents, a sister or brother is the most likely person to have the same antigens as the person with scd.
                
what happens during hsct?
                
first, stem cells are taken from the donor. after this, the person with scd (the recipient) is treated with drugs that destroy or reduce his or her own bone marrow stem cells.
                
the donor stem cells are then injected into the persons vein. the injected cells will make a home in the recipients bone marrow, gradually replacing the recipients cells. the new stem cells will make red cells that do not sickle.
                
which people receive hsct?
                
at the present time, most scd transplants are performed in children who have had complications such as strokes, acute chest crises, and recurring pain crises. these transplants usually use a matched donor.
                
because only about 1 in 10 children with scd has a matched donor without scd in their families, the number of people with scd who get transplants is low.
                
hsct is more risky in adults, and that is why most transplants are done in children.
                
there are several medical centers that are researching new scd hsct techniques in children and adults who dont have a matched donor in the family or are older than most recipients. hopefully, more people with scd will be able to receive a transplant in the future, using these new methods.
                
what are the risks?
                
hsct is successful in about 85 percent of children when the donor is related and hla matched. even with this high success rate, hsct still has risks.
                
complications can include severe infections, seizures, and other clinical problems. about 5 percent of people have died. sometimes transplanted cells attack the recipients organs (graft versus host disease).
                
medicines are given to prevent many of the complications, but they still can happen."
what is (are) pemphigus ?,"pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. if you have it, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your skin and mouth, causing blisters and sores. no one knows the cause. pemphigus does not spread from person to person. it does not appear to be inherited. but some people's genes put them more at risk for pemphigus.    pemphigoid is also an autoimmune skin disease. it leads to deep blisters that do not break easily. pemphigoid is most common in older adults and may be fatal for older, sick patients.    doctors diagnose pemphigus with a physical exam, a biopsy, and blood tests. the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid is the same: one or more medicines to control symptoms. these may include       - steroids, which reduce inflammation    - drugs that suppress the immune system response    - antibiotics to treat associated infections       nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases"
how many people are affected by moebius syndrome ?,"the exact incidence of moebius syndrome is unknown. researchers estimate that the condition affects 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 500,000 newborns."
what are the genetic changes related to dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ?,"dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22. this translocation, written as t(17;22), fuses part of the col1a1 gene from chromosome 17 with part of the pdgfb gene from chromosome 22. the translocation is found on one or more extra chromosomes that can be either the normal linear shape or circular. when circular, the extra chromosomes are known as supernumerary ring chromosomes. ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure. other genes from chromosomes 17 and 22 can be found on the extra chromosomes, but the role these genes play in development of the condition is unclear. the translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and the chromosomes containing the translocation are present only in the tumor cells. this type of genetic change is called a somatic mutation.  in normal cells, the col1a1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type i collagen, which strengthens and supports many tissues in the body. the pdgfb gene provides instructions for making one version (isoform) of the platelet derived growth factor (pdgf) protein. by attaching to its receptor, the active pdgfb protein stimulates many cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation).  the abnormally fused col1a1-pdgfb gene provides instructions for making an abnormal combined (fusion) protein that researchers believe ultimately functions like the pdgfb protein. the gene fusion leads to the production of an excessive amount of protein that functions like the pdgfb protein. in excess, this fusion protein stimulates cells to proliferate and differentiate abnormally, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.  the col1a1-pdgfb fusion gene is found in more than 90 percent of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases. in the remaining cases, changes in other genes may be associated with this condition. these genes have not been identified."

what are the genetic changes related to anencephaly ?,"anencephaly is a complex condition that is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown.  changes in dozens of genes in individuals with anencephaly and in their mothers may influence the risk of developing this type of neural tube defect. the best-studied of these genes is mthfr, which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the vitamin folate (also called vitamin b9). a shortage (deficiency) of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects. changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for anencephaly. however, none of these genes appears to play a major role in causing the condition.  researchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. as mentioned above, folate deficiency appears to play a significant role. studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, including anencephaly. other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus, obesity, exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy, and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy. however, it is unclear how these factors may influence the risk of anencephaly."
who is at risk for parasites - lice - body lice? ?,"body lice infestation is found worldwide but generally is limited to persons who live under conditions of crowding and poor hygiene who do not have access to regular bathing and changes of clean clothes, such as:
    
     - the homeless,
     - refugees,
     - survivors of war or natural disasters.
    
    
infestations can spread rapidly under such conditions. body lice infestation can occur in people of all races.
    
body lice are spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice or through contact with articles such as clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that have been in contact with an infested person. however, in the united states, actual infestation with body lice tends to be occur only in homeless, transient persons who do not have access to regular bathing and changes of clean clothes.
    
body lice can transmit disease. epidemics of typhus and louse-borne relapsing fever have been caused by body lice (typically in areas where climate, poverty, and social customs or war and social upheaval prevent regular changes and laundering of clothing)."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for cerebral atrophy ?,"the ninds funds research looking at many of the diseases and disorders that cause cerebral atrophy. understanding the biological mechanisms that cause neurons to die in the brain will help researchers find ways to prevent, treat, and even cure the diseases that lead to cerebral atrophy."
what is (are) galactosemia ?,"galactosemia is a disorder that affects how the body processes a simple sugar called galactose. a small amount of galactose is present in many foods. it is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas. the signs and symptoms of galactosemia result from an inability to use galactose to produce energy.  researchers have identified several types of galactosemia. these conditions are each caused by mutations in a particular gene and affect different enzymes involved in breaking down galactose.  classic galactosemia, also known as type i, is the most common and most severe form of the condition. if infants with classic galactosemia are not treated promptly with a low-galactose diet, life-threatening complications appear within a few days after birth. affected infants typically develop feeding difficulties, a lack of energy (lethargy), a failure to gain weight and grow as expected (failure to thrive), yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), liver damage, and abnormal bleeding. other serious complications of this condition can include overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis) and shock. affected children are also at increased risk of delayed development, clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract), speech difficulties, and intellectual disability. females with classic galactosemia may develop reproductive problems caused by an early loss of function of the ovaries (premature ovarian insufficiency).  galactosemia type ii (also called galactokinase deficiency) and type iii (also called galactose epimerase deficiency) cause different patterns of signs and symptoms. galactosemia type ii causes fewer medical problems than the classic type. affected infants develop cataracts but otherwise experience few long-term complications. the signs and symptoms of galactosemia type iii vary from mild to severe and can include cataracts, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, liver disease, and kidney problems."
what causes atherosclerosis ?,"the exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. however, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. it develops faster as you age.
                
atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. these factors include:
                
smoking
                
high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood
                
high blood pressure
                
high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes
                
plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open).
                
when this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (plate-lets) stick to the site of the injury. they may clump together to form blood clots. clots narrow the arteries even more, limiting the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.
                
depending on which arteries are affected, blood clots can worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack or stroke.
                
researchers continue to look for the causes of atherosclerosis. they hope to find answers to questions such as:
                
why and how do the arteries become damaged?
                
how does plaque develop and change over time?
                
why does plaque rupture and lead to blood clots?"
what causes lung cancer ?,"tobacco products and cancer using tobacco products has been shown to cause cancer. in fact, smoking tobacco, using smokeless tobacco, and being exposed regularly to secondhand tobacco smoke are responsible for a large number of cancer deaths in the u.s. each year. cigarette smoking causes lung cancer cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. scientists have reported widely on the link between cancer and smoking since the 1960s. since then, study after study has provided more proof that cigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer. before cigarette smoking became popular after world war i, doctors rarely, if ever, saw patients with lung cancer. but today, lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer. over 85 percent of people with lung cancer developed it because they smoked cigarettes. if you smoke if you smoke cigarettes, you are at much higher risk for lung cancer than a person who has never smoked. the risk of dying from lung cancer is 23 times higher for men who smoke and 13 times higher for women who smoke than for people who have never smoked. lung cancer can affect young and old alike.  stopping smoking greatly reduces your risk for developing lung cancer. after you stop, your risk levels off. ten years after the last cigarette, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by 50 percent -- which does not mean, however, that risk is eliminated. (watch the videos on this page to learn more about lung cancer, smoking and older adults. to enlarge the videos, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. to reduce the videos, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) smoking cigars and pipes also puts you at risk for lung cancer. cigar and pipe smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than nonsmokers. even cigar and pipe smokers who do not inhale are at increased risk for lung, mouth, and other types of cancer. the likelihood that a smoker will develop lung cancer is related to the age smoking began; how long the person smoked; the number of cigarettes, pipes, or cigars smoked per day; and how deeply the smoker inhaled.  learn about lung cancer prevention. other factors that increase your risk - many studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, are at increased risk of lung cancer. secondhand smoke is the smoke that non-smokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking. tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer. since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke.   - exposure to radon can put a person at risk for lung cancer, too. people who work in mines may be exposed to this invisible, odorless, and radioactive gas that occurs naturally in soil and rocks. it is also found in houses in some parts of the country. a kit available at most hardware stores allows homeowners to measure radon levels in their homes.   - another substance that can contribute to lung cancer is asbestos. asbestos has been used in shipbuilding, asbestos mining and manufacturing, insulation work, and brake repair, although products with asbestos have been largely phased out over the past several decades. if inhaled, asbestos particles can lodge in the lungs, damaging cells and increasing the risk for lung cancer.  many studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, are at increased risk of lung cancer. secondhand smoke is the smoke that non-smokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking. tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer. since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. exposure to radon can put a person at risk for lung cancer, too. people who work in mines may be exposed to this invisible, odorless, and radioactive gas that occurs naturally in soil and rocks. it is also found in houses in some parts of the country. a kit available at most hardware stores allows homeowners to measure radon levels in their homes. another substance that can contribute to lung cancer is asbestos. asbestos has been used in shipbuilding, asbestos mining and manufacturing, insulation work, and brake repair, although products with asbestos have been largely phased out over the past several decades. if inhaled, asbestos particles can lodge in the lungs, damaging cells and increasing the risk for lung cancer. it's never too late to quit  researchers continue to study the causes of lung cancer and to search for ways to prevent it. we already know that the best way to prevent lung cancer is to quit or never start smoking. the sooner a person quits smoking the better. even if you have been smoking for many years, it's never too late to benefit from quitting. get free help to quit smoking - each u.s. state and territory has a free quit line to provide you with information and resources to help you quit smoking. to reach the quit line in your area, dial toll-free, 1-800-quit-now (1-800-784-8669). each u.s. state and territory has a free quit line to provide you with information and resources to help you quit smoking. to reach the quit line in your area, dial toll-free, 1-800-quit-now (1-800-784-8669). - talk with a smoking cessation counselor from the national cancer institute (nci) for help quitting and for answers to smoking-related questions in english or spanish. call toll free within the united states, monday through friday 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. eastern time.1-877-44u-quit (1-877-448-7848) talk with a smoking cessation counselor from the national cancer institute (nci) for help quitting and for answers to smoking-related questions in english or spanish. call toll free within the united states, monday through friday 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. eastern time.1-877-44u-quit (1-877-448-7848) - get free information and advice about quitting smoking through a confidential online text chat with an information specialist from the national cancer institute's cancer information service. visit livehelp, available monday through friday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. eastern time. get free information and advice about quitting smoking through a confidential online text chat with an information specialist from the national cancer institute's cancer information service. visit livehelp, available monday through friday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. eastern time. you can also get help to quit smoking at these websites. - smokefree.gov.  - smokefree women  smokefree.gov. smokefree women for adults 50 and older, check out quitting smoking for older adults."

what causes lymphocytic vasculitis ?,"what causes lymphocytic vasculitis? lymphocytic vasculitis is thought to be caused by a number of different factors, such as infection, trauma, drug reaction, or an underlying condition such as arthritis.  because this condition is rare and not yet well understood, it is believed that a full list of possible causes has yet to be assembled."
is lymphangioleiomyomatosis inherited ?,"sporadic lam is not inherited. instead, researchers suggest that it is caused by a random mutation in the tsc1 or tsc2 gene that occurs very early in development. as a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the gene, while others have the mutated version. this situation is called mosaicism. when a mutation occurs in the other copy of the tsc1 or tsc2 gene in certain cells during a woman's lifetime (a somatic mutation), she may develop lam. these women typically have no history of this disorder in their family."
what is (are) hashimoto's syndrome ?,"hashimotos syndrome is a form of chronic inflammation that can damage the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce hormones (hypothyroidism). an early sign of the condition may be enlargement of the thyroid (called a goiter), which can potentially interfere with breathing or swallowing. other signs and symptoms may include tiredness, weight gain, thin and dry hair, joint or muscle pain, constipation, cold intolerance, and/or a slowed heart rate. affected women may have irregular menstrual periods or difficulty becoming pregnant. hashimotos syndrome is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the united states. it is more common in women than in men, and it usually appears in mid-adulthood. the exact cause is unknown but it is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. treatment is not always needed, but may include taking synthetic thyroid hormone."

is mixed connective tissue disease inherited ?,"is mixed connective tissue disease inherited? the role of genetics in the onset of mixed connective tissue disease (mctd) is still unclear. some people with mctd have family members who are also affected by the condition. this suggests that in some cases, an inherited predisposition may contribute to the development of mctd. people with an inherited or genetic predisposition have an increased risk of developing a certain condition due to their genes."
what is (are) adenosine deaminase deficiency ?,"adenosine deaminase (ada) deficiency is an inherited disorder that damages the immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (scid). people with scid lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. they are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. these infections are often caused by ""opportunistic"" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system.  the main symptoms of ada deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay.  most individuals with ada deficiency are diagnosed with scid in the first 6 months of life. without treatment, these babies usually do not survive past age 2. in about 10 percent to 15 percent of cases, onset of immune deficiency is delayed to between 6 and 24 months of age (delayed onset) or even until adulthood (late onset). immune deficiency in these later-onset cases tends to be less severe, causing primarily recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition, and other health problems."
what are the symptoms of hashimoto's encephalitis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of hashimoto's encephalitis? the symptoms of hashimoto's encephalitis can vary among affected people. they most often include sudden or subacute onset of confusion with alteration of consciousness. some affected people have multiple, recurrent episodes of neurological deficits with cognitive dysfunction. others experience a more progressive course characterized by slowly progressive cognitive impairment with dementia, confusion, hallucinations, or sleepiness. in some cases, rapid deterioration to coma can occur. in addition to confusion and mental status changes, symptoms may include seizures and myoclonus (muscle jerking) or tremor. psychosis, including visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions, has also been reported."
is acatalasemia inherited ?,"acatalasemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of the cat gene in each cell have mutations. when both copies of the gene are altered, the activity of catalase is reduced to less than 10 percent of normal.  when only one of the two copies of the cat gene has a mutation, the activity of catalase is reduced by approximately half. this reduction in catalase activity is often called hypocatalasemia. like acatalasemia, hypocatalasemia usually does not cause any health problems."
what is (are) mucopolysaccharidosis type vi ?,"mucopolysaccharidosis type vi (mps vi), also known as maroteaux-lamy syndrome, is a progressive condition that causes many tissues and organs to enlarge and become inflamed or scarred. skeletal abnormalities are also common in this condition. the rate at which symptoms worsen varies among affected individuals.  people with mps vi generally do not display any features of the condition at birth. they often begin to show signs and symptoms of mps vi during early childhood. the features of mps vi include a large head (macrocephaly), a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), distinctive-looking facial features that are described as ""coarse,"" and a large tongue (macroglossia). affected individuals also frequently develop heart valve abnormalities, an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). the airway may become narrow in some people with mps vi, leading to frequent upper respiratory infections and short pauses in breathing during sleep (sleep apnea). the clear covering of the eye (cornea) typically becomes cloudy, which can cause significant vision loss. people with mps vi may also have recurrent ear infections and hearing loss. unlike other types of mucopolysaccharidosis, mps vi does not affect intelligence.  mps vi causes various skeletal abnormalities, including short stature and joint deformities (contractures) that affect mobility. individuals with this condition may also have dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal abnormalities seen on x-ray. carpal tunnel syndrome develops in many children with mps vi and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. people with mps vi may develop a narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) in the neck, which can compress and damage the spinal cord.  the life expectancy of individuals with mps vi depends on the severity of symptoms. without treatment, severely affected individuals may survive only until late childhood or adolescence. those with milder forms of the disorder usually live into adulthood, although their life expectancy may be reduced. heart disease and airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with mps vi."
what is (are) ataxia telangiectasia ?,"ataxia-telangiectasia (a-t) is a rare, inherited disease. it affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. symptoms appear in young children, usually before age 5. they include       - ataxia - trouble coordinating movements    - poor balance     - slurred speech    - tiny, red spider veins, called telangiectasias, on the skin and eyes    - lung infections    - delayed physical and sexual development       people with a-t have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia. although it affects the brain, people with a-t usually have normal or high intelligence.    a-t has no cure. treatments might improve some symptoms. they include injections to strengthen the immune system, physical and speech therapy, and high-dose vitamins.     nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke"
what is (are) whipple disease ?,"whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine. the infection may spread to any organ in the body; however, it more commonly affects the
                
- joints  - central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves located throughout the body  - heart  - eyes  - lungs

what is (are) urinary tract infection in adults ?,"a uti is an infection in the urinary tract. infections are caused by microbesorganisms too small to be seen without a microscopeincluding fungi, viruses, and bacteria. bacteria are the most common cause of utis. normally, bacteria that enter the urinary tract are rapidly removed by the body before they cause symptoms. however, sometimes bacteria overcome the bodys natural defenses and cause infection. an infection in the urethra is called urethritis. a bladder infection is called cystitis. bacteria may travel up the ureters to multiply and infect the kidneys. a kidney infection is called pyelonephritis."
what is (are) myoclonus-dystonia ?,"myoclonus-dystonia is a movement disorder that typically affects the upper half of the body. individuals with this condition experience quick, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) that usually affects their arms, neck, and trunk. less frequently, the legs are involved as well. more than half of affected individuals also develop dystonia, which is a pattern of involuntary muscle contractions that causes twisting and pulling movements of specific body parts. the dystonia associated with myoclonus-dystonia may affect a single part of the body, causing isolated problems such as a writer's cramp in the hand, or it may involve multiple areas of the body. rarely, people with this condition have dystonia as their only symptom.  the movement problems usually appear in childhood or early adolescence, and myoclonus is typically the initial symptom. myoclonus may be triggered by movement or stimulation of the affected body area, stress, sudden noise, or caffeine. in some cases, the myoclonus gets worse over time; in other cases, people experience a spontaneous improvement (remission) of their symptoms. it is unclear why the movement abnormalities improve in some people but not in others.  people with myoclonus-dystonia may have an increased risk for developing psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd)."
what are the symptoms of polycythemia vera ?,"symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side. polycythemia vera often does not cause early signs or symptoms. it may be found during a routine blood test. signs and symptoms may occur as the number of blood cells increases. other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - a feeling of pressure or fullness below the ribs on the left side.    - headaches.    - double vision or seeing dark or blind spots that come and go.    - itching all over the body, especially after being in warm or hot water.    - reddened face that looks like a blush or sunburn.    - weakness.    - dizziness.    - weight loss for no known reason."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for skin cancer ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what is (are) prescription and illicit drug abuse ?,"the prescription medications most commonly abused by people of any age are opioids (painkillers), depressants, and stimulants. doctors prescribe opioids to relieve pain and, sometimes, to treat severe coughs and diarrhea. common opioid prescription medications include the following: - morphine (ms contin, kadian, avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain  - codeine (tylenol with codeine, robitussin ac), which is prescribed for mild pain  - hydrocodone (vicodin, lortab, zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain  - oxycodone (oxycontin, percodan, percocet, tylox, roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain   - fentanyl (duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain  morphine (ms contin, kadian, avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain codeine (tylenol with codeine, robitussin ac), which is prescribed for mild pain hydrocodone (vicodin, lortab, zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain oxycodone (oxycontin, percodan, percocet, tylox, roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain fentanyl (duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain for more on opioids, see  what are the possible consequences of opioid use and abuse?"" depressants are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. the types of depressants that are most commonly abused are barbiturates (secobarbital ,mebaral and nembutal) and benzodiazepines (valium, librium, and xanax). for more on depressants, see what are the possible consequences of cns depressant use and abuse?""  stimulants are used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), and depression that has not responded to other treatments. these medications increase alertness, attention, and energy. stimulants include methylphenidate (ritalin and concerta), and amphetamines (adderall). for more on stimulants, see  what are the possible consequences of stimulant use and abuse?"""
what is (are) nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma ?,"nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (nbcie) is a specific type of ichthyosis mainly affecting the skin. most infants with nbcie are born with a tight, shiny covering on their skin, called a collodion membrane, which is typically shed within a few weeks. other signs and symptoms include redness of the skin (erythroderma); fine, white scales on the skin; and thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of feet (palmoplantar keratoderma). some people with nbcie also have outward turning eyelids (ectropion); outward turning lips (eclabium); and nails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). nbcie may be caused by mutations in any one of at least three genes: alox12b, aloxe3 or nipal4. in some people with nbcie, the cause of the disorder is unknown."
what is (are) bartter syndrome ?,"bartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body.  in some cases, bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. the disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth.  beginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). they lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). in addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness).  two major forms of bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. one form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. the other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe. once the genetic causes of bartter syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different types based on the genes involved. types i, ii, and iv have the features of antenatal bartter syndrome. because type iv is also associated with hearing loss, it is sometimes called antenatal bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. type iii usually has the features of classical bartter syndrome."
what are the genetic changes related to cone-rod dystrophy ?,"mutations in approximately 30 genes are known to cause cone-rod dystrophy. approximately 20 of these genes are associated with the form of cone-rod dystrophy that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. mutations in the abca4 gene are the most common cause of autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, accounting for 30 to 60 percent of cases. at least 10 genes have been associated with cone-rod dystrophy that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. mutations in the gucy2d and crx genes account for about half of these cases. changes in at least two genes cause the x-linked form of the disorder, which is rare.  the genes associated with cone-rod dystrophy play essential roles in the structure and function of specialized light receptor cells (photoreceptors) in the retina. the retina contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision.  mutations in any of the genes associated with cone-rod dystrophy lead to a gradual loss of rods and cones in the retina. the progressive degeneration of these cells causes the characteristic pattern of vision loss that occurs in people with cone-rod dystrophy. cones typically break down before rods, which is why sensitivity to light and impaired color vision are usually the first signs of the disorder. (the order of cell breakdown is also reflected in the condition name.) night vision is disrupted later, as rods are lost.  some of the genes associated with cone-rod dystrophy are also associated with other eye diseases, including a group of related eye disorders called rod-cone dystrophy. rod-cone dystrophy has signs and symptoms similar to those of cone-rod dystrophy. however, rod-cone dystrophy is characterized by deterioration of the rods first, followed by the cones, so night vision is affected before daylight and color vision. the most common form of rod-cone dystrophy is a condition called retinitis pigmentosa."
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet. being on dialysis changes this. most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue. the better nourished you are, the healthier you will be. you will also have greater resistance to infection and recover from surgery more quickly.
                
your body breaks protein down into a waste product called urea. if urea builds up in your blood, it's a sign you have become very sick. eating mostly high-quality proteins is important because they produce less waste than others. high-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs (especially egg whites).
                

                
talk with a dietitian   meat, fish, and chicken are good sources of protein. talk with a dietitian about the meats you eat.   i will eat ______ servings of meat each day. a regular serving size is 3 ounces. this is about the size of the palm of your hand or a deck of cards.   try to choose lean (low-fat) meats that are also low in phosphorus. if you are a vegetarian, ask about other ways to get your protein.   low-fat milk is a good source of protein. but milk is high in phosphorus and potassium. and milk adds to your fluid intake. talk with a dietitian to see if milk fits into your food plan.   i (will) (will not) drink milk. i will drink ______ cup(s) of milk a day."
what are the symptoms of paget's disease of bone ?,"symptoms many people don't know they have paget's disease because they have a mild case of the disease and do not have any symptoms. however, people with more advanced cases of the disease will likely have symptoms. symptoms vary depending on which bone or bones are affected. people with paget's disease may experience - bone pain  - misshapen bones  - fractures  - osteoarthritis of the joints adjacent to bone affected by the disease.  bone pain misshapen bones fractures osteoarthritis of the joints adjacent to bone affected by the disease. paget's disease can also cause a variety of neurological complications as a result of compression of nerve tissue by bone affected by the disease. misshapen bone is most obvious when the leg bones, skull, or bones of the spine are affected. leg bones may become bowed, the skull may become enlarged, and malformed spinal bones may cause curvature of the spine. complications people with paget's disease also are more likely to break bones because bones affected by the disease are more fragile. enlarged and malformed bones can distort the position of bones and joints. this causes wear and tear on the joints next to bones affected by paget's disease, resulting in arthritis. on very rare occasions, paget's disease is linked to the development of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. less than one percent of patients have this complication."
how to diagnose catamenial pneumothorax ?,how might catamenial pneumothorax be diagnosed? the diagnosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who have several episodes of spontaneous lung collapse (pneumothoraces) and have endometriosis. medical thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopy may confirm the diagnosis.
what are the genetic changes related to achromatopsia ?,"achromatopsia results from changes in one of several genes: cnga3, cngb3, gnat2, pde6c, or pde6h. a particular cngb3 gene mutation underlies the condition in pingelapese islanders.  achromatopsia is a disorder of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. the retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones. these cells transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain through a process called phototransduction. rods provide vision in low light (night vision). cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision.  mutations in any of the genes listed above prevent cones from reacting appropriately to light, which interferes with phototransduction. in people with complete achromatopsia, cones are nonfunctional, and vision depends entirely on the activity of rods. the loss of cone function leads to a total lack of color vision and causes the other vision problems. people with incomplete achromatopsia retain some cone function. these individuals have limited color vision, and their other vision problems tend to be less severe.  some people with achromatopsia do not have identified mutations in any of the known genes. in these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. other genetic factors that have not been identified likely contribute to this condition."

what is (are) usher syndrome ?,"usher syndrome is a condition characterized by hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss. the loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (rp), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. in some cases of usher syndrome, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). many people with retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives, however.  researchers have identified three major types of usher syndrome, designated as types i, ii, and iii. these types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. type i is further divided into seven distinct subtypes, designated as types ia through ig. usher syndrome type ii has at least three described subtypes, designated as types iia, iib, and iic.  individuals with usher syndrome type i are typically born completely deaf or lose most of their hearing within the first year of life. progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes apparent in childhood. this type of usher syndrome also includes problems with the inner ear that affect balance. as a result, children with the condition begin sitting independently and walking later than usual.  usher syndrome type ii is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. the hearing loss associated with this form of usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects high tones. affected children have problems hearing high, soft speech sounds, such as those of the letters d and t. the degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition. unlike other forms of usher syndrome, people with type ii do not have difficulties with balance caused by inner ear problems.  people with usher syndrome type iii experience progressive hearing loss and vision loss beginning in the first few decades of life. unlike the other forms of usher syndrome, infants with usher syndrome type iii are usually born with normal hearing. hearing loss typically begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of speech, and progresses over time. by middle age, most affected individuals are profoundly deaf. vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops in late childhood or adolescence. people with usher syndrome type iii may also experience difficulties with balance due to inner ear problems. these problems vary among affected individuals, however."
what causes metabolic syndrome ?,"metabolic syndrome has several causes that act together. you can control some of the causes, such as overweight and obesity, an inactive lifestyle, and insulin resistance.
                
you can't control other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome, such as growing older. your risk for metabolic syndrome increases with age.
                
you also can't control genetics (ethnicity and family history), which may play a role in causing the condition. for example, genetics can increase your risk for insulin resistance, which can lead to metabolic syndrome.
                
people who have metabolic syndrome often have two other conditions: excessive blood clotting and constant, low-grade inflammation throughout the body. researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.
                
researchers continue to study conditions that may play a role in metabolic syndrome, such as:
                
a fatty liver (excess triglycerides and other fats in the liver)
                
polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries)

what are the treatments for lip and oral cavity cancer ?,"key points
                    - there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer.     - patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer.    - two types of standard treatment are used:         - surgery      - radiation therapy         - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.          - chemotherapy      - hyperfractionated radiation therapy     - hyperthermia therapy        - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer.
                    treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. because the lips and oral cavity are important for breathing, eating, and talking, patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment. the medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals with special training in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. these include the following:         - head and neck surgeon.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  dentist.    -  speech therapist.    -  dietitian.    -  psychologist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.    -  plastic surgeon.
                
                
                    two types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery      surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of lip and oral cavity cancer. surgery may include the following:            -  wide local excision: removal of the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. if cancer has spread into bone, surgery may include removal of the involved bone tissue.      -  neck dissection: removal of lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck. this is done when cancer may have spread from the lip and oral cavity.     -  plastic surgery: an operation that restores or improves the appearance of parts of the body. dental implants, a skin graft, or other plastic surgery may be needed to repair parts of the mouth, throat, or neck after removal of large tumors.           even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat lip and oral cavity cancer.    radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment. it is also important for patients to have a dental exam before radiation therapy begins, so that existing problems can be treated.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       hyperfractionated radiation therapy     hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into small doses and the treatments are given more than once a day.        hyperthermia therapy     hyperthermia therapy is a treatment in which body tissue is heated above normal temperature to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what is the outlook for epilepsy ?,"while epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. it is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. for many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities.
                
epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for anencephaly ?,"research supported by the ninds includes studies to understand how the brain and nervous system normally develop. these studies contribute to a greater understanding of neural tube disorders, such as anencephaly, and open promising new avenues to treat and prevent neurological birth defects."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for depression ?,"treating older adults studies show that the majority of older adults with depression improve when they receive treatment with an antidepressant, psychotherapy or a combination of both. in addition, research has indicated that treating depression in older adults often improves the outcomes of co-existing medical conditions. some research has also suggested that the risk for developing depression in people who have had a stroke may be reduced if they receive preventative treatment with an antidepressant or talk therapy. special considerations however, there are some special considerations that doctors must take into account when treating older adults. the commonly prescribed medications for depression may not work well for some older adults because they may interact unfavorably with other medications being taken for other conditions. some older adults with depression may also have some problems thinking clearly, and these individuals often respond poorly to the drugs. which form of treatment is most effective? many older adults prefer to get counseling or psychotherapy for depression rather than add more medications to those they are already taking for other conditions. research suggests that for older adults, psychotherapy is just as likely to be an effective first treatment for depression as taking an antidepressant. there is a great deal of evidence indicating that cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt), including a version called problem solving therapy, may be an especially useful type of psychotherapy for treating older adults and improving their quality of life. however, a practical issue to consider when deciding on treatment is that it may be harder for many older people to find or be able to travel to meetings with a well-trained psychotherapist than to get a prescription for antidepressant medication from their primary care doctor. also, some research suggests that treatment with medication may be more effective if the depression is quite severe or if the older adult is coping with other serious illnesses. overall, research has suggested that, when possible, a combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment is likely to be most effective in treating depression in older adults and, in particular, for reducing the number of new episodes. late-life depression is often undiagnosed despite progress in treatment research, late-life depression often goes undiagnosed or is inadequately treated in older adults. in fact, several studies have found that up to 75 percent of older adults who die by suicide had visited their primary care doctors within one month of their deaths. collaborative or comprehensive care may lead to better treatment results. collaborative care the prevention of suicide in primary care elderly: collaborative trial (prospect) offered antidepressant medication and/or psychotherapy to depressed older adults, along with a ""care manager"" -- a social worker, nurse or psychologist -- who monitored their symptoms, side effects of medication, and progress. the study found that those participants who had case-managed care got better more quickly, had longer periods without depression, and in general responded better to treatment than those who did not have case-managed care. another study called the improving mood: promoting access to collaborative treatment (impact) trial also found that collaborative care was more effective than usual care, and was less expensive over the long run as well. improving diagnosis of depression several studies are looking at ways to help older adults get better access to depression treatment. one is developing and testing an education and intervention program to help primary care clinics and providers identify and treat late-life depression. another study found that depressed older adults who had a ""care manager"" monitor their symptoms, side effects, and progress got better more quickly -- and stayed better longer -- than those who did not have case-managed care. still other projects are investigating ways of improving older adults engagement in and ability to follow treatment plans for depression. researchers are also looking at ways to -  better understand the relationship between other medical illnesses and depression   - integrate treatment for depression with treatments for other medical conditions a person may have  - produce a quicker response to treatment   - develop new methods for delivering treatment to those who are homebound, unable to move around without assistance, or who live in rural areas. (e.g., via use of telephonic or internet-assisted therapies)  - help prevent depression by keeping it from developing or recurring in those at risk or by preventing those with milder symptoms from progressing to more severe episodes of depression. better understand the relationship between other medical illnesses and depression integrate treatment for depression with treatments for other medical conditions a person may have produce a quicker response to treatment develop new methods for delivering treatment to those who are homebound, unable to move around without assistance, or who live in rural areas.

what is (are) lujan syndrome ?,"lujan syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). affected people also tend to have characteristic physical features such as a tall and thin body; a large head (macrocephaly); and a thin face with distinctive facial features (prominent top of the nose, short space between the nose and the upper lip, narrow roof of the mouth, crowded teeth and a small chin). most of the cases occur in males. lujan syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the med12 gene and is inherited in an x-linked manner. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include special education; physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for developmental delays; and medications to control seizures."
what are the genetic changes related to van der woude syndrome ?,"mutations in the irf6 gene cause van der woude syndrome. the irf6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in early development. this protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and helps control the activity of particular genes.  the irf6 protein is active in cells that give rise to tissues in the head and face. it is also involved in the development of other parts of the body, including the skin and genitals.  mutations in the irf6 gene that cause van der woude syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from making any functional protein. a shortage of the irf6 protein affects the development and maturation of tissues in the face, resulting in the signs and symptoms of van der woude syndrome."
how to diagnose breast cancer ?,"tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.
                    check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   clinical breast exam (cbe): an exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. the doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.    -  mammogram: an x-ray of the breast.     -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -    mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of both breasts. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. if a lump in the breast is found, a biopsy may be done.  there are four types of biopsy used to check for breast cancer:               -  excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lump of tissue.       -  incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.       -  core biopsy : the removal of tissue using a wide needle.       -  fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : the removal of tissue or fluid, using a thin needle.
                
                
                    if cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.
                    decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests. the tests give information about:         - how quickly the cancer may grow.    - how likely it is that the cancer will spread through the body.    - how well certain treatments might work.    - how likely the cancer is to recur (come back).        tests include the following:         -   estrogen and progesterone receptor test : a test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. if there are more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. the test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone may stop the cancer from growing.    -   human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (her2/neu) test : a laboratory test to measure how many her2/neu genes there are and how much her2/neu protein is made in a sample of tissue. if there are more her2/neu genes or higher levels of her2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called her2/neu positive. this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. the cancer may be treated with drugs that target the her2/neu protein, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab.    -  multigene tests: tests in which samples of tissue are studied to look at the activity of many genes at the same time. these tests may help predict whether cancer will spread to other parts of the body or recur (come back). there are many types of multigene tests. the following multigene tests have been studied in clinical trials:               -  oncotype dx : this test helps predict whether stage i or stage ii breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and node negative will spread to other parts of the body. if the risk that the cancer will spread is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.      -  mammaprint : this test helps predict whether stage i or stage ii breast cancer that is node negative will spread to other parts of the body. if the risk that the cancer will spread is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.                 based on these tests, breast cancer is described as one of the following types:         -  hormone receptor positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive) or hormone receptor negative (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor negative).    - her2/neu positive or her2/neu negative.    -  triple negative (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and her2/neu negative).         this information helps the doctor decide which treatments will work best for your cancer."
is medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?,"how is medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (mcad) deficiency inherited? medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency (mcadd) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have mutations for a person to be affected. usually, the parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition each have one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."

what are the symptoms of williams syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of williams syndrome? the signs and symptoms of williams syndrome can be variable, but the disorder is generally characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety.  people with williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. attention deficit disorder (add), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder. the most significant medical problem associated with williams syndrome is a form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (svas). svas is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). if this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with williams syndrome.  young children with williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. many affected people have dental problems such as small, widely spaced teeth and teeth that are crooked or missing. in older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt. additional signs and symptoms of williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. affected children may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for williams syndrome. if the information is available, the

is charcot-marie-tooth disease inherited ?,"the pattern of inheritance varies with the type of charcot-marie-tooth disease. cmt1, most cases of cmt2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. this pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person has one affected parent.  cmt4, a few cmt2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  cmtx is inherited in an x-linked dominant pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. in most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the x chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, who have two x chromosomes. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons. all daughters of affected men will have one altered x chromosome, but they may only have mild symptoms of the disorder.  some cases of charcot-marie-tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

what is (are) parasitic diseases ?,"parasites are living things that use other living things - like your body - for food and a place to live. you can get them from contaminated food or water, a bug bite, or sexual contact. some parasitic diseases are easily treated and some are not.    parasites range in size from tiny, one-celled organisms called protozoa to worms that can be seen with the naked eye. some parasitic diseases occur in the united states. contaminated water supplies can lead to giardia infections. cats can transmit toxoplasmosis, which is dangerous for pregnant women. others, like malaria, are common in other parts of the world.     if you are traveling, it's important to drink only water you know is safe. prevention is especially important. there are no vaccines for parasitic diseases. some medicines are available to treat parasitic infections."
what is (are) neuroaxonal dystrophy ?,"infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (inad) is a rare inherited neurological disorder. it affects axons, the part of a nerve cell that carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, and causes progressive loss of vision, muscular control, and mental skills. while the basic genetic and metabolic causes are unknown, inad is the result of an abnormal build-up of toxic substances in nerves that communicate with muscles, skin, and the conjunctive tissue around the eyes. symptoms usually begin within the first 2 years of life, with the loss of head control and the ability to sit, crawl, or walk, accompanied by deterioration in vision and speech. some children may have seizures. distinctive facial deformities may be present at birth, including a prominent forehead, crossed eyes, an unusually small nose or jaw, and large, low-set ears. inad is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the defective gene that causes inad to pass it on to their child. electrophysiology (nerve conduction velocities) may be helpful for diagnosis, although diagnosis is usually confirmed by tissue biopsy of skin, rectum, nerve or conjunctive tissue to confirm the presence of characteristic swellings (spheroid bodies) in the nerve axons."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for restless legs syndrome ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct and support rls research in laboratories at the nih and at major medical institutions across the country. the goal of this research is to increase scientific understanding of rls, find improved methods of diagnosing and treating the syndrome, and discover ways to prevent it."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for sotos syndrome ?,"the ninds supports and conducts a wide range of studies which focus on identifying and learning more about the genes involved in normal brain development. the knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, thus, may eventually give clues to understanding disorders such as sotos syndrome."
how many people are affected by multiple pterygium syndrome ?,the prevalence of multiple pterygium syndrome is unknown.
who is at risk for skin cancer? ?,"skin color and being exposed to sunlight can increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. risk factors for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma include the following:         - being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.     - having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.       - blue or green or other light-colored eyes.       - red or blond hair.             - having actinic keratosis.     - past treatment with radiation.    - having a weakened immune system.     - having certain changes in the genes that are linked to skin cancer.    - being exposed to arsenic."
how many people are affected by hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia ?,"hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is thought to be a rare condition, but its prevalence is unknown."
what is (are) silicosis ?,"silicosis is a respiratory disease caused by breathing in (inhaling) silica dust. there are three types of silicosis: simple chronic silicosis, the most common type of silicosis, results from long-term exposure (usually more than 20 years) to low amounts of silica dust. simple chronic silicosis may cause people to have difficulty breathing.  accelerated silicosis occurs after 5 to 15 years of exposure of higher levels of silica. swelling of the lungs and other symptoms occur faster in this type of silicosis than in the simple chronic form.  acute silicosis results from short-term exposure (weeks or months) of large amounts of silica. the lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels. a cough, weight loss, and fatigue may also be present. acute silicosis progresses rapidly and can be fatal within months.  people who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust (mining, quarrying, construction, sand blasting, stone cutting) are at risk of developing this condition."
what are the genetic changes related to otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia ?,mutations in the col11a2 gene cause osmed. the col11a2 gene is one of several genes that provide instructions for the production of type xi collagen. this type of collagen is important for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. mutations in the col11a2 gene that cause osmed disrupt the production or assembly of type xi collagen molecules. the loss of type xi collagen prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly.
what is (are) renal tubular acidosis ?,"type 1: classical distal rta
                
type 1 is also called classical distal rta. ""distal,"" which means distant, refers to the point in the urine-forming tube of the kidney where the defect occursrelatively distant from the point where fluid from the blood enters the tiny tube, or tubule, that collects fluid and wastes to form urine.
                
this disorder may be inherited as a primary disorder or may be one symptom of a disease that affects many parts of the body. researchers have discovered abnormal genes responsible for the inherited forms of the disease. more often, however, classical distal rta occurs as a result of systemic diseasesdiseases that affect many organ systemslike the autoimmune disorders sjgren's syndrome and lupus, which also attack the distal tubule.
                
other diseases and conditions associated with classical distal rta include sickle cell anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, a hereditary form of deafness, analgesic nephropathy, rejection of a transplanted kidney, renal medullary cystic disease, obstructive uropathy, and chronic urinary tract infections. many of these conditions cause abnormal calcium deposits to build up in the kidney and impair distal tubule function.
                
a major consequence of classical distal rta is a low blood potassium level. the level drops if the kidneys excrete too much potassium into urine instead of returning it to the blood supply. because potassium helps regulate nerve and muscle health and heart rate, low levels can cause extreme weakness, irregular heartbeat, paralysis, and even death.
                
untreated classical distal rta causes growth retardation in children and progressive kidney and bone disease in adults. restoring normal growth and preventing kidney stones are the major goals of therapy. if acidosis is corrected with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, then low blood-potassium, salt depletion, and calcium leakage into urine will be corrected. this alkali therapy also helps decrease the development of kidney stones and stabilizes kidney function so kidney failure does not progress. infants may need potassium supplements, but older children and adults rarely do because alkali therapy prevents the kidney from excreting potassium into the urine.
                
type 2: proximal rta
                
type 2 is also called proximal rta. the word ""proximal,"" which means near, indicates that the defect is closer to the point where fluid and wastes from the blood enter the tubule.
                
this form of rta occurs most frequently in children as part of a disorder called fanconi's syndrome. the features of fanconi's syndrome include the abnormal excretion of glucose, amino acids, citrate, and phosphate into the urine, as well as vitamin d deficiency and low blood-potassium.
                
proximal rta can also result from inherited disorders that disrupt the body's normal breakdown and use of nutrients. examples include the rare disease cystinosis, in which cystine crystals are deposited in bones and other tissues; hereditary fructose intolerance; and wilson disease.
                
proximal rta also occurs in patients treated with ifosfamide, a drug used in chemotherapy. a few older drugssuch as acetazolamide or outdated tetracyclinecan also cause proximal rta. in adults, proximal rta may complicate diseases like multiple myeloma, or it may occur in people who experience chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney.
                
when possible, identifying and correcting the underlying causes are important steps in treating the acquired forms of proximal rta. the diagnosis is based on the chemical analysis of blood and urine samples. children with this disorder would likely receive large doses of an oral alkali, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, to treat acidosis and prevent bone disorders, kidney stones, and growth failure. correcting acidosis and low potassium levels restores normal growth patterns, allowing bone to mature while preventing further renal disease. vitamin d supplements may also be needed to help prevent bone problems.
                
type 3
                
type 3 is rarely used as a classification because it is now thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2.
                
type 4: hyperkalemic rta
                
type 4 is also called hyperkalemic rta and is caused by a generalized transport abnormality of the distal tubule. the transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium that normally occurs in the distal tubule is impaired. this form is distinguished from classical distal rta and proximal rta because it results in high levels of potassium in the blood instead of low levels. either low potassiumhypokalemiaor high potassiumhyperkalemiacan be a problem because potassium is important in regulating heart rate.
                
type 4 rta occurs when blood levels of the hormone aldosterone are low or when the kidneys do not respond to it. aldosterone directs the kidneys to regulate the levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the blood. type 4 rta also occurs when the tubule transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium is impaired due to an inherited disorder or the use of certain drugs.
                
drugs that may cause type 4 rta include
                
- diuretics used to treat congestive heart failure such as spironolactone or eplerenone  - blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs)  - the antibiotic trimethoprim  - the antibiotic pentamidine, which is used to treat pneumonia  - an agent called heparin that keeps blood from clotting  - a class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)  - some immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection
                
type 4 rta may also result from diseases that alter kidney structure and function such as diabetic nephropathy, hiv/aids, addison's disease, sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, lupus, amyloidosis, removal or destruction of both adrenal glands, and kidney transplant rejection.
                
for people who produce aldosterone but cannot use it, researchers have identified the genetic basis for their body's resistance to the hormone. to treat type 4 rta successfully, patients may require alkaline agents to correct acidosis and medication to lower the potassium in their blood.
                
if treated early, most people with any type of rta will not develop permanent kidney failure. therefore, the goal is early recognition and adequate therapy, which will need to be maintained and monitored throughout the person's lifetime."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for adult central nervous system tumors ?,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     proton beam radiation therapy     proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. this type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. it is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.        biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.    biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. treatments may include the following:            -  dendritic cell vaccine therapy.     -  gene therapy.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
what is (are) cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy ?,"cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, commonly known as carasil, is an inherited condition that causes stroke and other impairments.  abnormalities affecting the brain and other parts of the nervous system become apparent in an affected person's twenties or thirties. often, muscle stiffness (spasticity) in the legs and problems with walking are the first signs of the disorder. about half of affected individuals have a stroke or similar episode before age 40. as the disease progresses, most people with carasil also develop mood and personality changes, a decline in thinking ability (dementia), memory loss, and worsening problems with movement.  other characteristic features of carasil include premature hair loss (alopecia) and attacks of low back pain. the hair loss often begins during adolescence and is limited to the scalp. back pain, which develops in early to mid-adulthood, results from the breakdown (degeneration) of the discs that separate the bones of the spine (vertebrae) from one another.  the signs and symptoms of carasil worsen slowly with time. over the course of several years, affected individuals become less able to control their emotions and communicate with others. they increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living; after a few years, they become unable to care for themselves. most affected individuals die within a decade after signs and symptoms first appear, although few people with the disease have survived for 20 to 30 years."
is bladder cancer inherited ?,"bladder cancer is typically not inherited. most often, tumors result from genetic mutations that occur in bladder cells during a person's lifetime. these noninherited genetic changes are called somatic mutations."
how to diagnose prostate cancer ?,"the doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, mri, or ct scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. but to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. during a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. if a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope."
is zap70-related severe combined immunodeficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how to diagnose adult non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect (find) and diagnose adult non-hodgkin lymphoma. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light. this test is used to diagnose lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.    -   bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -   lymph node biopsy: the removal of all or part of a lymph node. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. one of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lymph node.       -  incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node.      -  core biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle.       -  fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy: the removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.      -  laparoscopy : a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.      -  laparotomy : a surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.                 if cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:          -   immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.    -   cytogenetic analysis : a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.    -   fish (fluorescence in situ hybridization): a laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. pieces of dna that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. when these pieces of dna attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light. this type of test is used to look for certain genetic markers.    -   immunophenotyping : a process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this process is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.        other tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body."
what is the outlook for oxygen therapy ?,"during an emergencysuch as a serious accident, possible heart attack, or other life-threatening eventyou might be started on oxygen therapy right away.
                
otherwise, your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on test results. an arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test can measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.
                
for an arterial blood gas test, a small needle is inserted into an artery, usually in your wrist. a sample of blood is taken from the artery. the sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen level is measured.
                
for a pulse oximetry test, a small sensor is attached to your fingertip or toe. the sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.
                
if the tests show that your blood oxygen level is low, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. in the prescription, your doctor will include the number of liters of oxygen per minute that you need (oxygen flow rate). he or she also will include how often you need to use the oxygen (frequency of use).
                
frequency of use includes when and for how long you should use the oxygen. depending on your condition and blood oxygen level, you may need oxygen only at certain times, such as during sleep or while exercising.
                
if your doctor prescribes home oxygen therapy, he or she can help you find a home equipment provider. the provider will give you the equipment and other supplies you need."
what is (are) alkaptonuria ?,"alkaptonuria is an inherited condition that causes urine to turn black when exposed to air. ochronosis, a buildup of dark pigment in connective tissues such as cartilage and skin, is also characteristic of the disorder. this blue-black pigmentation usually appears after age 30. people with alkaptonuria typically develop arthritis, particularly in the spine and large joints, beginning in early adulthood. other features of this condition can include heart problems, kidney stones, and prostate stones."
how to diagnose proteinuria ?,"until recently, an accurate protein measurement required a 24-hour urine collection. in a 24-hour collection, the patient urinates into a container, which is kept refrigerated between trips to the bathroom. the patient is instructed to begin collecting urine after the first trip to the bathroom in the morning. every drop of urine for the rest of the day is to be collected in the container. the next morning, the patient adds the first urination after waking and the collection is complete.
                
in recent years, researchers have found that a single urine sample can provide the needed information. in the newer technique, the amount of albumin in the urine sample is compared with the amount of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. the measurement is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uacr). a urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine (30 mg/g) is a warning that there may be a problem. if the laboratory test exceeds 30 mg/g, another uacr test should be done 1 to 2 weeks later. if the second test also shows high levels of protein, the person has persistent proteinuria, a sign of declining kidney function, and should have additional tests to evaluate kidney function."
is fish-eye disease inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the symptoms of collagenous colitis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of collagenous colitis? all individuals with collagenous colitis experience chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhea which is what typically prompts individuals to seek medical attention. onset of diarrhea may occur gradually over time or may be sudden and abrupt. episodes of diarrhea may be intermittent and can occur over weeks, months or years. other signs and symptoms that commonly occur in affected individuals include abdominal pain or cramping; flatulence; bloating; and weight loss. incontinence, urgency, nausea, vomiting and fatigue have also been reported. some individuals with collagenous colitis experience spontaneous remission even without treatment; however, relapses can occur."
what are the genetic changes related to bartter syndrome ?,"bartter syndrome can be caused by mutations in at least five genes. mutations in the slc12a1 gene cause type i. type ii results from mutations in the kcnj1 gene. mutations in the clcnkb gene are responsible for type iii. type iv can result from mutations in the bsnd gene or from a combination of mutations in the clcnka and clcnkb genes.  the genes associated with bartter syndrome play important roles in normal kidney function. the proteins produced from these genes are involved in the kidneys' reabsorption of salt. mutations in any of the five genes impair the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt, leading to the loss of excess salt in the urine (salt wasting). abnormalities of salt transport also affect the reabsorption of other charged atoms (ions), including potassium and calcium. the resulting imbalance of ions in the body leads to the major features of bartter syndrome.  in some people with bartter syndrome, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown. researchers are searching for additional genes that may be associated with this condition."
"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer ?","new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

what are the genetic changes related to dystonia 6 ?,"dystonia 6 is caused by mutations in the thap1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes. through this function, it is thought to help control several processes in the body, including the growth and division (proliferation) of endothelial cells, which line the inside surface of blood vessels and other circulatory system structures called lymphatic vessels. the thap1 protein also plays a role in the self-destruction of cells that are no longer needed (apoptosis).  studies indicate that most of the thap1 gene mutations that cause dystonia 6 affect the stability of the thap1 protein, reducing the amount of functional thap1 protein available for dna binding. other mutations may impair the protein's ability to bind with the correct regions of dna. problems with dna binding likely disrupt the proper regulation of gene activity, leading to the signs and symptoms of dystonia 6.  a particular thap1 gene mutation is specific to a mennonite population in the midwestern united states in which dystonia 6 was first described. this mutation changes the dna sequence in a region of the gene known as exon 2. some researchers use the term dyt6 dystonia to refer to dystonia caused by this particular mutation, and the broader term thap1 dystonia to refer to dystonia caused by any thap1 gene mutation. in general, mutations affecting the region of the thap1 protein that binds to dna, including the mutation found in the mennonite population, tend to result in more severe signs and symptoms than mutations affecting other regions of the protein."
what are the genetic changes related to waldenstrm macroglobulinemia ?,"waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is thought to result from a combination of genetic changes. the most common known genetic change associated with this condition is a mutation in the myd88 gene, which is found in more than 90 percent of affected individuals. another gene commonly associated with waldenstrm macroglobulinemia, cxcr4, is mutated in approximately 30 percent of affected individuals (most of whom also have the myd88 gene mutation). other genetic changes believed to be involved in waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have not yet been identified. studies have found that certain regions of dna are deleted or added in some people with the condition; however, researchers are unsure which genes in these regions are important for development of the condition. the mutations that cause waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the abnormal blood cells.  the proteins produced from the myd88 and cxcr4 genes are both involved in signaling within cells. the myd88 protein relays signals that help prevent the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells, thus aiding in cell survival. the cxcr4 protein stimulates signaling pathways inside the cell that help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. mutations in these genes lead to production of proteins that are constantly functioning (overactive). excessive signaling through these overactive proteins allows survival and proliferation of abnormal cells that should undergo apoptosis, which likely contributes to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in waldenstrm macroglobulinemia."
what causes synovial chondromatosis ?,"what causes synovial chondromatosis? the exact underlying cause of synovial chondromatosis is unknown. some research suggests that trauma may play a role in its development because the condition primarily occurs in weight-bearing joints. infection has also been considered as a contributing factor. the condition is not inherited. synovial chondromatosis can reportedly occur as either a primary or secondary form. primary synovial chondromatosis, which is more rare, occurs spontaneously and does not appear to relate to any pre-existing conditions. secondary synovial chondromatosis is the more common form and often occurs when there is pre-existent osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, neuropathic osteoarthropathy (which often occurs in diabetic individuals), tuberculosis, or osteochondral fractures (torn cartilage covering the end of a bone in a joint) in the affected individual."

is distal arthrogryposis type 1 inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in many cases, a person with distal arthrogryposis type 1 has a parent and other close family members with the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to andersen-tawil syndrome ?,"mutations in the kcnj2 gene cause andersen-tawil syndrome.  the kcnj2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a channel across cell membranes. this channel transports positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into muscle cells. the movement of potassium ions through these channels is critical for maintaining the normal functions of muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and cardiac muscle. mutations in the kcnj2 gene alter the usual structure and function of potassium channels or prevent the channels from being inserted correctly into the cell membrane. many mutations prevent a molecule called pip2 from binding to the channels and effectively regulating their activity. these changes disrupt the flow of potassium ions in skeletal and cardiac muscle, leading to the periodic paralysis and irregular heart rhythm characteristic of andersen-tawil syndrome.  researchers have not determined the role of the kcnj2 gene in bone development, and it is not known how mutations in the gene lead to the developmental abnormalities often found in andersen-tawil syndrome."

what is (are) epilepsy ?,"the epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. in epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. the epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. a measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy."
what are the treatments for kyrle disease ?,"how might kyrle disease be treated? kyrle disease is most often associated with a systemic disorder, although idiopathic cases without any associated disease have occurred. therefore, treatment is typically directed toward the underlying condition when appropriate. for individuals in whom itching is a major problem, soothing antipruritic lotions containing menthol and camphor may be helpful. sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine may also be helpful for pruritus, especially at night. some improvement has been reported with high doses of vitamin a, with or without vitamin e. topical retinoic acid cream may also improve the symptoms. another approach to treatment uses oral retinoids, which resulted in alleviation of symptoms in one study. etretinate in high doses is also reportedly effective, but relapse has been reported following discontinuation of therapy. uv light therapy is reportedly particularly helpful for individuals with widespread lesions or coexisting pruritus from renal or hepatic disease. carbon dioxide laser or cryosurgery may be helpful for limited lesions, but caution may be recommended for individuals with dark skin, especially with cryosurgery, and for lesions on the lower legs, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or poor circulation."

what is (are) cranioectodermal dysplasia ?,"cranioectodermal dysplasia is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. the most common features involve bone abnormalities and abnormal development of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. the signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.  distinctive abnormalities of the skull and face are common in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia. most affected individuals have a prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and an elongated head (dolichocephaly) due to abnormal fusion of certain skull bones (sagittal craniosynostosis). a variety of facial abnormalities can occur in people with this condition; these include low-set ears that may also be rotated backward, an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus), and outside corners of the eyes that point upward or downward (upslanting or downslanting palpebral fissures) among others.  development of bones in the rest of the skeleton is also affected in this condition. abnormalities in the long bones of the arms and legs (metaphyseal dysplasia) lead to short limbs and short stature. in addition, affected individuals often have short fingers (brachydactyly). some people with this condition have short rib bones and a narrow rib cage, which can cause breathing problems, especially in affected newborns.  abnormal development of ectodermal tissues in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia can lead to sparse hair, small or missing teeth, short fingernails and toenails, and loose skin.  cranioectodermal dysplasia can affect additional organs and tissues in the body. a kidney disorder known as nephronophthisis occurs in many people with this condition, and it can lead to a life-threatening failure of kidney function known as end-stage renal disease. abnormalities of the liver, heart, or eyes also occur in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia."
how many people are affected by ehlers-danlos syndrome ?,"although it is difficult to estimate the overall frequency of ehlers-danlos syndrome, the combined prevalence of all types of this condition may be about 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. the hypermobility and classical forms are most common; the hypermobility type may affect as many as 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people, while the classical type probably occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people.  other forms of ehlers-danlos syndrome are very rare. about 30 cases of the arthrochalasia type and about 60 cases of the kyphoscoliosis type have been reported worldwide. about a dozen infants and children with the dermatosparaxis type have been described. the vascular type is also rare; estimates vary widely, but the condition may affect about 1 in 250,000 people."
what are the genetic changes related to chediak-higashi syndrome ?,"chediak-higashi syndrome is caused by mutations in the lyst gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. researchers believe that this protein plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of materials into structures called lysosomes and similar cell structures. lysosomes act as recycling centers within cells. they use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components.  mutations in the lyst gene impair the normal function of the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein, which disrupts the size, structure, and function of lysosomes and related structures in cells throughout the body. in many cells, the lysosomes are abnormally large and interfere with normal cell functions. for example, enlarged lysosomes in certain immune system cells prevent these cells from responding appropriately to bacteria and other foreign invaders. as a result, the malfunctioning immune system cannot protect the body from infections.  in pigment cells called melanocytes, cellular structures called melanosomes (which are related to lysosomes) are abnormally large. melanosomes produce and distribute a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. people with chediak-higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism because melanin is trapped within the giant melanosomes and is unable to contribute to skin, hair, and eye pigmentation.  researchers believe that abnormal lysosome-like structures inside blood cells called platelets underlie the abnormal bruising and bleeding seen in people with chediak-higashi syndrome. similarly, abnormal lysosomes in nerve cells probably cause the neurological problems associated with this disease."
how many people are affected by spastic paraplegia type 2 ?,"the prevalence of all hereditary spastic paraplegias combined is estimated to be 2 to 6 in 100,000 people worldwide. spastic paraplegia type 2 likely accounts for only a small percentage of all spastic paraplegia cases."
what is (are) genitopatellar syndrome ?,"genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.  the genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and underdevelopment of the scrotum. affected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.  missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees or an inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot. bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis have also been reported.  genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. affected individuals may have an usually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum).  people with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples. many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. the condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth."

what is (are) heart valve disease ?,"heart valve disease occurs if one or more of your heart valves don't work well. the heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral,and aortic valves.
                
these valves have tissue flaps that open and close with each heartbeat. the flaps make sure blood flows in the right direction through your heart's four chambers and to the rest of your body.
                
healthy heart cross-section
                

                
birth defects, age-related changes, infections, or other conditions can cause one or more of your heart valves to not open fully or to let blood leak back into the heart chambers. this can make your heart work harder and affect its ability to pump blood.
                
overview
                
how the heart valves work
                
at the start of each heartbeat, blood returning from the body and lungs fills the atria (the heart's two upper chambers). the mitral and tricuspid valves are located at the bottom of these chambers. as the blood builds up in the atria, these valves open to allow blood to flow into the ventricles (the heart's two lower chambers).
                
after a brief delay, as the ventricles begin to contract, the mitral and tricuspid valves shut tightly. this prevents blood from flowing back into the atria.
                
as the ventricles contract, they pump blood through the pulmonary and aortic valves. the pulmonary valve opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. this artery carries blood to the lungs to get oxygen.
                
at the same time, the aortic valve opens to allow blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. the aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body. as the ventricles relax, the pulmonary and aortic valves shut tightly. this prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles.

heart valve problems
                
heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: regurgitation, stenosis, and atresia.
                
regurgitation, or backflow, occurs if a valve doesn't close tightly. blood leaks back into the chambers rather than flowing forward through the heart or into an artery.
                
in the united states, backflow most often is due to prolapse. ""prolapse"" is when the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back into an upper heart chamber during a heartbeat. prolapse mainly affects the mitral valve.
                
stenosis occurs if the flaps of a valve thicken, stiffen, or fuse together. this prevents the heart valve from fully opening. as a result, not enough blood flows through the valve. some valves can have both stenosis and backflow problems.
                
atresia occurs if a heart valve lacks an opening for blood to pass through.
                
some people are born with heart valve disease, while others acquire it later in life. heart valve disease that develops before birth is called congenitalheart valve disease. congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other congenital heart defects.
                
congenital heart valve disease often involves pulmonary or aortic valves that don't form properly. these valves may not have enough tissue flaps, they may be the wrong size or shape, or they may lack an opening through which blood can flow properly.
                
acquired heart valve disease usually involves aortic or mitral valves. although the valves are normal at first, problems develop over time.
                
both congenital and acquired heart valve disease can cause stenosis or backflow.
                
outlook
                
many people have heart valve defects or disease but don't have symptoms. for some people, the condition mostly stays the same throughout their lives and doesn't cause any problems.
                
for other people, heart valve disease slowly worsens until symptoms develop. if not treated, advanced heart valve disease can cause heart failure, stroke, blood clots, or death due to sudden cardiac arrest (sca).
                
currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. however, lifestyle changes and medicines can relieve many of its symptoms and complications. 
                
these treatments also can lower your risk of developing a life-threatening condition, such as stroke or sca. eventually, you may need to have your faulty heart valve repaired or replaced.
                
some types of congenital heart valve disease are so severe that the valve is repaired or replaced during infancy, childhood, or even before birth. other types may not cause problems until middle-age or older, if at all."
what is (are) early infantile epileptic encephalopathy ?,"ohtahara syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures.  the disorder affects newborns, usually within the first three months of life (most often within the first 10 days) in the form of epileptic seizures.  infants have primarily tonic seizures (which cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms), but may also experience partial seizures, and rarely, myoclonic seizures (which cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs). ohtahara syndrome is most commonly caused by metabolic disorders or structural damage in the brain, although the cause or causes for many cases cant be determined. most infants with the disorder show significant underdevelopment of part or all of the cerebral hemispheres.  the eegs of infants with ohtahara syndrome reveal a characteristic pattern of high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little activity.  this pattern is known as burst suppression. the seizures associated with ohtahara syndrome are difficult to treat and the syndrome is severely progressive. some children with this condition go on to develop other epileptic disorders such as west syndrome and lennox-gestaut syndrome."
what is (are) gastrointestinal stromal tumors ?,"key points
                    - gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract.    - genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.     - signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit.    - tests that examine the gi tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumors.    - very small gists are common.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract.
                    the gastrointestinal (gi) tract is part of the bodys digestive system. it helps to digest food and takes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food so they can be used by the body. the gi tract is made up of the following organs:         -  stomach.    -  small intestine.    -  large intestine (colon).         gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) may be malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer). they are most common in the stomach and small intestine but may be found anywhere in or near the gi tract. some scientists believe that gists begin in cells called interstitial cells of cajal (icc), in the wall of the gi tract.      see the pdq summary about unusual cancers of childhood treatment for information on the treatment of gist in children.
                
                 
                    very small gists are common.
                    sometimes gists are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil. tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason, such as an x-ray or surgery. some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body. doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow."
what is (are) colorectal cancer ?,"the three standard treatments for colon cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. surgery, however, is the most common first step in the treatment for all stages of colon cancer. surgery is an operation to remove the cancer. a doctor may remove the cancer using several types of surgery. for rectal cancer, radiation treatment also is an option."
what causes waterhousefriderichsen syndrome ?,"what causes waterhouse-friderichsen syndrome? waterhouse-friderichsen syndrome is most often associated with meningococcal disease (accounts for 80% of cases). the syndrome also has been associated with other bacterial pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae (group b), salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and plesiomonas shigelloides. it may also be associated with a history of splenectomy. in rare cases, it may be caused by the use of medications that promote blood clotting, low platelet counts, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, renal vein thrombosis or steroid use. while the exact mechanism of disease is not clear, activation of several cytokine mediators appears to lead to sepsis and shock."
what is (are) hairy cell leukemia ?,"hairy cell leukemia is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many b cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell that fights infection. the condition is named after these excess b cells which look 'hairy' under a microscope. as the number of leukemia cells increases, fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are produced. the underlying cause of this condition is unknown. while there is no cure, treatment can lead to remission which can last for years."
what are the treatments for iron-deficiency anemia ?,"treatment for iron-deficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity. treatments may include dietary changes and supplements, medicines, and surgery.
                
severe iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous (iv) iron therapy. treatment may need to be done in a hospital.

you may need iron supplements to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. iron supplements can correct low iron levels within months. supplements come in pill form or in drops for children.
                
large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. keep iron supplements out of reach from children. this will prevent them from taking an overdose of iron.
                
iron supplements can cause side effects, such as dark stools, stomach irritation, and heartburn. iron also can cause constipation, so your doctor may suggest that you use a stool softener.
                
your doctor may advise you to eat more foods that are rich in iron. the best source of iron is red meat, especially beef and liver. chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish also are good sources of iron.
                
the body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods. however, some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels. examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:
                
iron-fortified breads and cereals
                
peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas
                
tofu
                
dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
                
spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
prune juice
                
the nutrition facts labels on packaged foods will show how much iron the items contain. the amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.
                
vitamin c
                
vitamin c helps the body absorb iron. good sources of vitamin c are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitamin c than canned ones.
                
if you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. grapefruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.
                
other fruits rich in vitamin c include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.
                
vegetables rich in vitamin c include broccoli, peppers, brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.
                
treatment to stop bleeding
                
if blood loss is causing iron-deficiency anemia, treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding. for example, if you have a bleeding ulcer, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics and other medicines to treat the ulcer.
                
if a polyp or cancerous tumor in your intestine is causing bleeding, you may need surgery to remove the growth.
                
if you have heavy menstrual flow, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help reduce your monthly blood flow. in some cases, surgery may be advised.
                
treatments for severe iron-deficiency anemia
                
blood transfusion
                
if your iron-deficiency anemia is severe, you may get a transfusion of red blood cells. a blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an iv line in one of your blood vessels. a transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
a transfusion of red blood cells will treat your anemia right away. the red blood cells also give a source of iron that your body can reuse. however, a blood transfusion is only a short-term treatment. your doctor will need to find and treat the cause of your anemia.
                
blood transfusions are usually reserved for people whose anemia puts them at a higher risk for heart problems or other severe health issues.
                
for more information, go to the health topics blood transfusion article.
                
iron therapy
                
if you have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend iron therapy. for this treatment, iron is injected into a muscle or an iv line in one of your blood vessels.
                
iv iron therapy presents some safety concerns. it must be done in a hospital or clinic by experienced staff. iron therapy usually is given to people who need iron long-term but can't take iron supplements by mouth. this therapy also is given to people who need immediate treatment for iron-deficiency anemia."
what are the genetic changes related to anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency ?,"mutations in the ikbkg gene cause x-linked recessive eda-id, and mutations in the nfkbia gene cause autosomal dominant eda-id. the proteins produced from these two genes regulate nuclear factor-kappa-b. nuclear factor-kappa-b is a group of related proteins (a protein complex) that binds to dna and controls the activity of other genes, including genes that direct the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. it also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).  the ikbkg and nfkbia gene mutations responsible for eda-id result in the production of proteins with impaired function, which reduces activation of nuclear factor-kappa-b. these changes disrupt certain signaling pathways within immune cells, resulting in immune deficiency. it is unclear how gene mutations alter the development of the skin, teeth, sweat glands, and other tissues, although it is likely caused by abnormal nuclear factor-kappa-b signaling in other types of cells."

what is (are) sickle cell disease ?,"sickle cell disease is a group of disorders that affects hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. people with this disorder have atypical hemoglobin molecules called hemoglobin s, which can distort red blood cells into a sickle, or crescent, shape.  signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease usually begin in early childhood. characteristic features of this disorder include a low number of red blood cells (anemia), repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain. the severity of symptoms varies from person to person. some people have mild symptoms, while others are frequently hospitalized for more serious complications.  the signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease are caused by the sickling of red blood cells. when red blood cells sickle, they break down prematurely, which can lead to anemia. anemia can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and delayed growth and development in children. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells may also cause yellowing of the eyes and skin, which are signs of jaundice. painful episodes can occur when sickled red blood cells, which are stiff and inflexible, get stuck in small blood vessels. these episodes deprive tissues and organs of oxygen-rich blood and can lead to organ damage, especially in the lungs, kidneys, spleen, and brain. a particularly serious complication of sickle cell disease is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). pulmonary hypertension occurs in about one-third of adults with sickle cell disease and can lead to heart failure."
what is (are) charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2b ?,"charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2b (cmt2b) affects the peripheral nerves, the nerves running from outside the brain and spine. common signs and symptoms include slowly progressive weakness and numbness in the feet, lower leg muscles, hands, and forearms. this type of cmt is also associated with the formation of ulcers in the hands and feet. symptoms may start in childhood to early adulthood, although later onset (>50 years) has also been described. symptoms of cmt2b vary but tend to be similar to that of cmt type 1. cmt2b is caused by changes in the rab7a gene. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
what are the genetic changes related to alagille syndrome ?,"in more than 90 percent of cases, mutations in the jag1 gene cause alagille syndrome. another 7 percent of individuals with alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that include the jag1 gene. a few people with alagille syndrome have mutations in a different gene, called notch2. the jag1 and notch2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that fit together to trigger interactions called notch signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development. this signaling influences how the cells are used to build body structures in the developing embryo. changes in either the jag1 gene or notch2 gene probably disrupt the notch signaling pathway. as a result, errors may occur during development, especially affecting the bile ducts, heart, spinal column, and certain facial features."

what are the treatments for laron syndrome ?,"how might laron syndrome be treated? there is currently no cure for laron syndrome. treatment is primarily focused on improving growth. the only specific treatment available for this condition is subcutaneous injections of insulin-like growth factor 1 (a growth-promoting hormone), often called igf-1. igf-1 stimulates linear growth (height) and also improves brain growth and metabolic abnormalities caused by long-term igf-1 deficiency. it has also been shown to raise blood glucose levels, reduce cholesterol, and increase muscle growth. igf-1 and gh levels should be closely monitored in people undergoing this treatment because overdosage of igf-i causes a variety of health problems."
what are the genetic changes related to hypercholesterolemia ?,"mutations in the apob, ldlr, ldlrap1, and pcsk9 genes cause hypercholesterolemia.  high blood cholesterol levels typically result from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. lifestyle choices including diet, exercise, and tobacco smoking strongly influence the amount of cholesterol in the blood. additional factors that impact cholesterol levels include a person's gender, age, and health problems such as diabetes and obesity. a small percentage of all people with high cholesterol have an inherited form of hypercholesterolemia. the most common cause of inherited high cholesterol is a condition known as familial hypercholesterolemia, which results from mutations in the ldlr gene.  the ldlr gene provides instructions for making a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor. this type of receptor binds to particles called low-density lipoproteins (ldls), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. by removing low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream, these receptors play a critical role in regulating cholesterol levels. some ldlr mutations reduce the number of low-density lipoprotein receptors produced within cells. other mutations disrupt the receptors' ability to remove low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. as a result, people with mutations in the ldlr gene have very high levels of blood cholesterol. as the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart.  less commonly, hypercholesterolemia can be caused by mutations in the apob, ldlrap1, or pcsk9 gene. changes in the apob gene result in a form of inherited hypercholesterolemia known as familial defective apolipoprotein b-100 (fdb). ldlrap1 mutations are responsible for another type of inherited high cholesterol, autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (arh). proteins produced from the apob, ldlrap1, and pcsk9 genes are essential for the normal function of low-density lipoprotein receptors. mutations in any of these genes prevent the cell from making functional receptors or alter the receptors' function. hypercholesterolemia results when low-density lipoprotein receptors are unable to remove cholesterol from the blood effectively.  researchers are working to identify and characterize additional genes that may influence cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease in people with hypercholesterolemia."
is spondylothoracic dysostosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in children ?,"the symptoms of ibs include abdominal pain or discomfort and changes in bowel habits. to meet the definition of ibs, the pain or discomfort should be associated with two of the following three symptoms:
                
- start with bowel movements that occur more or less often than usual  - start with stool that appears looser and more watery or harder and more lumpy than usual  - improve with a bowel movement
                
other symptoms of ibs may include

what is (are) lynch syndrome ?,"lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. individuals with lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin, and prostate. women with lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. even though the disorder was originally described as not involving noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon, people with lynch syndrome may occasionally have colon polyps. lynch syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is caused by a mutation in the mlh1, msh2, msh6, pms2 or epcam gene."
is syngap1-related intellectual disability inherited ?,"syngap1-related intellectual disability is classified as an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. almost all cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. in at least one case, an affected person inherited the mutation from one affected parent."
what is (are) leber hereditary optic neuropathy ?,"leber hereditary optic neuropathy (lhon) is an inherited form of vision loss. although this condition usually begins in a person's teens or twenties, rare cases may appear in early childhood or later in adulthood. for unknown reasons, males are affected much more often than females.  blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of lhon. these vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. over time, vision in both eyes worsens with a severe loss of sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. this condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. vision loss results from the death of cells in the nerve that relays visual information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerve). although central vision gradually improves in a small percentage of cases, in most cases the vision loss is profound and permanent.  vision loss is typically the only symptom of lhon; however, some families with additional signs and symptoms have been reported. in these individuals, the condition is described as ""lhon plus."" in addition to vision loss, the features of lhon plus can include movement disorders, tremors, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects). some affected individuals develop features similar to multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic disorder characterized by muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness, and a variety of other health problems."
how many people are affected by intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare disorder. its prevalence is unknown. the prevalence of secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction is also unknown, but it is believed to be more common than the primary form."
how to diagnose graves' disease ?,"health care providers can sometimes diagnose graves disease based only on a physical examination and a medical history. blood tests and other diagnostic tests, such as the following, then confirm the diagnosis.
                
tsh test. the ultrasensitive tsh test is usually the first test performed. this test detects even tiny amounts of tsh in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available.
                
t3 and t4 test. another blood test used to diagnose graves disease measures t3 and t4 levels. in making a diagnosis, health care providers look for below-normal levels of tsh, normal to elevated levels of t4, and elevated levels of t3.
                
because the combination of low tsh and high t3 and t4 can occur with other thyroid problems, health care providers may order other tests to finalize the diagnosis. the following two tests use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine because the thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone.
                
radioactive iodine uptake test. this test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. high levels of iodine uptake can indicate graves disease.
                
thyroid scan. this scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. with graves disease the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodulessmall lumps in the glandshow a different pattern of iodine distribution.
                
tsi test. health care providers may also recommend the tsi test, although this test usually isnt necessary to diagnose graves disease. this test, also called a tsh antibody test, measures the level of tsi in the blood. most people with graves disease have this antibody, but people whose hyperthyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.
                
more information about testing for thyroid problems is provided in the niddk health topic, thyroid tests."
what causes acute intermittent porphyria ?,"what causes acute intermittent porphyria (aip)? aip is caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called porphobilinogen deaminase (pbgd), also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase (hmbs) and formerly known as uroporphyrinogen i-synthase. the deficiency of pbgd is caused by a mutation in the hmbs gene. the hmbs gene is the only gene known to be associated with aip. however, the deficiency of pbgd alone is not enough to cause aip. other activating factors (e.g., hormones, drugs, dietary changes) must also be present."

what is the outlook for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - the type of germ cell tumor.    - where the tumor first began to grow.    - the stage of the cancer (whether it has spread to nearby areas or to other places in the body).    - how well the tumor responds to treatment (lower afp and -hcg levels).    - whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.    - the patient's age and general health.    - whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        the prognosis for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, especially ovarian germ cell tumors, is good."
what are the symptoms of nance-horan syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of nance-horan syndrome? the main features of nance-horan syndrome include congenital cataracts, dental abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and in some cases, intellectual disability. in affected males, the primary physical characteristic is the presence of dense clouding of the lens (cornea) of both eyes at birth (congenital bilateral cataracts). the cataracts usually result in blurred vision and severely decreased clearness or clarity of vision (visual acuity). vision loss can potentially be profound. males with nance-horan syndrome may have additional eye abnormalities, including a very small cornea (microcornea); involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and/or misalignment of the eyes (strabismus). in some cases, the entire eye may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) and/or the upper eyelid may droop (ptosis). males with nance-horan syndrome may also have several dental abnormalities such as unusually shaped, extra (supernumerary) teeth, absence of some teeth (dental agenesis), impacted teeth or unusually wide spaces (diastema) between some of the teeth. the front teeth, or incisors, are usually tapered and 'screwdriver-shaped'. the teeth in the back of the mouth may be cone-shaped, rounded, or cylindrical. in many males with nance-horan syndrome, other physical findings may also occur. distinctive facial features may be present, but may be subtle. the ears may be flared forward and unusually prominent. affected males may also have a large, prominent nose with a high, narrow nasal bridge, a narrow prominent jaw, and sometimes a long, narrow face. some males with nance-horan syndrome may also experience delays the skills necessary for coordinating muscular and mental activity. in addition, some reports suggest that approximately 20 to 30 percent of affected males may have varying levels of intellectual disability, which is usually mild to moderate; but in some cases can be severe. females who carry a single copy of the mutation in the nhs gene may develop some symptoms of the disorder. however, symptoms are usually milder and more variable than those seen in males. affected females may have abnormally small corneas (microcornea) and/or some clouding of the cornea. vision may be normal, or there may be slightly decreased visual acuity. without appropriate treatment, clouding of the cornea can lead to total cataracts later in life. females often have some dental abnormalities, such as abnormally-shaped front teeth and/or unusually wide spaces between some of the teeth. affected females usually do not develop intellectual disability. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for nance-horan syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal nasal morphology 90% cataract 90% long face 90% mandibular prognathia 90% microcornea 90% nystagmus 90% prominent nasal bridge 90% visual impairment 90% intellectual disability, moderate 80% abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% cognitive impairment 50% increased number of teeth 50% strabismus 50% aplasia/hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% behavioral abnormality 7.5% glaucoma 7.5% retinal detachment 7.5% autism - broad finger - congenital cataract - diastema - macrotia - microphthalmia - narrow face - posterior y-sutural cataract - prominent nose - screwdriver-shaped incisors - short phalanx of finger - supernumerary maxillary incisor - visual loss - x-linked dominant inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for what i need to know about hirschsprung disease ?,"pull-through procedure
                
hd is treated with surgery called a pull-through procedure. a surgeon removes the segment of the large intestine lacking nerve cells and connects the healthy segment to the anus. the pull-through procedure is usually done soon after diagnosis.
                
ostomy surgery
                
an ostomy allows stool to leave the body through an opening in the abdomen. although most children with hd do not need an ostomy, a child who has been very sick from hd may need an ostomy to get better before the pull-through procedure.
                
for ostomy surgery, the surgeon first takes out the diseased segment of the large intestine. the end of the healthy intestine is moved to an opening in the abdomen where a stoma is created. a stoma is created by rolling the intestines end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. an ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect stool. the pouch will need to be emptied several times each day.
                

                
if the surgeon removes the entire large intestine and connects the small intestine to the stoma, the surgery is called an ileostomy. if the surgeon leaves part of the large intestine and connects it to the stoma, the surgery is called a colostomy.
                
later, during the pull-through procedure, the surgeon removes the stoma and closes the abdomen with stitches."
what are the genetic changes related to zap70-related severe combined immunodeficiency ?,"as the name indicates, this condition is caused by mutations in the zap70 gene. the zap70 gene provides instructions for making a protein called zeta-chain-associated protein kinase. this protein is part of a signaling pathway that directs the development of and turns on (activates) immune system cells called t cells. t cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection.  the zap70 gene is important for the development and function of several types of t cells. these include cytotoxic t cells (cd8+ t cells), whose functions include destroying cells infected by viruses. the zap70 gene is also involved in the activation of helper t cells (cd4+ t cells). these cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells.  mutations in the zap70 gene prevent the production of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase or result in a protein that is unstable and cannot perform its function. a loss of functional zeta-chain-associated protein kinase leads to the absence of cd8+ t cells and an excess of inactive cd4+ t cells. the resulting shortage of active t cells causes people with zap70-related scid to be more susceptible to infection."

what is (are) psoriasis ?,"psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. you usually get the patches on your elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet, but they can show up on other parts of your body. some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.    a problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. in a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. normally, this takes a month. in psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast.     psoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope.    psoriasis can last a long time, even a lifetime. symptoms come and go. things that make them worse include       - infections    - stress    - dry skin    - certain medicines       psoriasis usually occurs in adults. it sometimes runs in families. treatments include creams, medicines, and light therapy.    nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases"
what is yersiniosis for yersinia ?,"yersiniosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus yersinia. in the united states, most human illness is caused by one species, y. enterocolitica. infection with y. enterocolitica can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the age of the person infected. infection with y. enterocolitica occurs most often in young children. common symptoms in children are fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which is often bloody. symptoms typically develop 4 to 7 days after exposure and may last 1 to 3 weeks or longer. in older children and adults, right-sided abdominal pain and fever may be the predominant symptoms, and may be confused with appendicitis. in a small proportion of cases, complications such as skin rash, joint pains, or spread of bacteria to the bloodstream can occur."
is nonsyndromic aplasia cutis congenita inherited ?,"most cases of nonsyndromic aplasia cutis congenita are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. when the condition runs in families, inheritance usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. rarely, the condition appears to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how many people are affected by dicer1 syndrome ?,dicer1 syndrome is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown.
how to prevent coronary microvascular disease ?,"no specific studies have been done on how to prevent coronary microvascular disease.
                
researchers dont yet know how or in what way preventing coronary microvascular disease differs from preventing coronary heart disease. coronary microvascular disease affects the tiny coronary arteries; coronary heart disease affects the large coronary arteries.
                
taking action to control risk factors for heart disease can help prevent or delay coronary heart disease. you cant control some risk factors, such as older age and family history of heart disease. however, you can take steps to prevent or control other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, overweight and obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking.
                
heart-healthy lifestyle changes and ongoing medical care can help you lower your risk for heartdisease.
                
heart-healthy lifestyle changes
                
your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have coronary microvascular disease. heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:
                
heart-healthy eating
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
managing stress
                
physical activity
                
quitting smoking
                
heart-healthy eating
                
your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:
                
fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas.
                
when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
a lot of red meat
                
palm and coconut oils
                
sugary foods and beverages
                
two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. when you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. to help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
not all fats are bad. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels.
                
some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
avocados
                
corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
peanut butter
                
salmon and trout
                
tofu
                
sodium
                
you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
dietary approaches to stop hypertension
                
your doctor may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about dash.
                
alcohol
                
try to limit alcohol intake. too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. one drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. aim for a healthy weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
knowing your body mass index (bmi) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. to figure out your bmi, check out the national heart, lung, and blood institutes (nhlbi) online bmi calculator or talk to your doctor. a bmi:
                
below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
a general goal to aim for is a bmi below 25. your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal.
                
measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. this risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk.
                
if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower ldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol.
                
managing stress
                
research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.
                
learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
a stress management program
                
meditation
                
physical activity
                
relaxation therapy
                
talking things out with friends or family
                
physical activity
                
routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including ldl (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your hdl cholesterol level. hdl is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
quitting smoking
                
if you smoke, quit. smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

ongoing medical care
                
learn more about heart disease and the traits, conditions, and habits that can raise your risk for developing it. talk with your doctor about your risk factors for heart disease and how to controlthem.
                
if lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your risk factors. take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. visit your doctor regularly and have recommended testing.
                
know your numbers. ask your doctor for these three tests and have the results explained toyou:
                
blood pressure measurement.
                
fasting blood glucose. this test is for diabetes.
                
lipoprotein panel. this test measures total cholesterol, ldl (bad) cholesterol, hdl (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).
                
finally, know your family history of heart disease. if you or someone in your family has heart disease, tell your doctor."
what are the symptoms of heart palpitations ?,"symptoms of palpitations include feelings that your heart is:
                
skipping a beat
                
fluttering
                
beating too hard or too fast
                
you may have these feelings in your chest, throat, or neck. they can occur during activity or even when you're sitting still or lying down.
                
palpitations often are harmless, and your heart is working normally. however, these feelings can be a sign of a more serious problem if you also:
                
feel dizzy or confused
                
are light-headed, think you may faint, or do faint

have pain, pressure, or tightness in your chest, jaw, or arms
                
feel short of breath
                
have unusual sweating
                
your doctor may have already told you that your palpitations are harmless. even so, see your doctor again if your palpitations:
                
start to occur more often or are more noticeable or bothersome
                
occur with other symptoms, such as those listed above
                
your doctor will want to check whether your palpitations are the symptom of a heart problem, such as an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)."

                    - pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas.    - smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.    - signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss.    - pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.    - tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas.
                    the pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. the wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. the pancreas lies between the stomach and the spine.     the pancreas has two main jobs in the body:         - to make juices that help digest (break down) food.    - to make hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that help control blood sugar levels. both of these hormones help the body use and store the energy it gets from food.         the digestive juices are made by exocrine pancreas cells and the hormones are made by endocrine pancreas cells. about 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells.   this summary is about exocrine pancreatic cancer. for information on endocrine pancreatic cancer, see the pdq summary on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors) treatment.   for information on pancreatic cancer in children, see the pdq summary on unusual cancers of childhood treatment."

                    - prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.    - prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the united states.
                
                
                    prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.
                    the prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. the prostate is just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). it is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). the prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of the semen.       as men age, the prostate may get bigger. a bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. this condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). bph is not cancer, but surgery may be needed to correct it. the symptoms of bph or of other problems in the prostate may be like symptoms of prostate cancer."

what are the treatments for bethlem myopathy ?,"how might bethlem myopathy be treated? the treatment for behtlem myopathy is symptomatic and supportive. this means that treatment is directed at the individual symptoms that are present in each case. there is no cure. in most cases, physical therapy, stretching exercises, splinting, and/or mobility aids are employed. in rare cases, surgery may be needed (i.e. for achilles tendon contractures or scoliosis)."
what is (are) heart block ?,"heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. this system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (""rate"" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. ""rhythm"" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.)
                
with each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. as it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood.
                
heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.
                
overview
                
heart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-rith-me-ah). an arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.
                
some people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. if you're born with the condition, it's called congenital (kon-jen-ih-tal) heart block. if the condition develops after birth, it's called acquired heart block.
                
doctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.
                
acquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage.
                
the three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. first degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. this is true for both congenital and acquired heart block.
                
doctors use a test called an ekg (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. this test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. it maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review.
                
outlook
                
the symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. first-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms.
                
second-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. this type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint.
                
third-degree heart block limits the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. this type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal.
                
a medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. this device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block.
                
all types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (a-tre-al fih-brih-la-shun). talk with your doctor to learn more about the signs and symptoms of arrhythmias."
what causes myh7-related scapuloperoneal myopathy ?,"what causes myh7-related scapuloperoneal myopathy? myh7-related scapuloperoneal myopathy is caused by mutations in the myh7 gene. this gene, located on chromosome 14q12, provides instructions for making a protein known as the cardiac beta ()-myosin heavy chain. this protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and in type i skeletal muscle fibers. type i fibers, which are also known as slow-twitch fibers, are one of two types of fibers that make up skeletal muscles. type i fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue. for example, muscles involved in posture, such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady, are made predominantly of type i fibers."

what are the genetic changes related to irak-4 deficiency ?,"irak-4 deficiency is caused by mutations in the irak4 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in stimulating the immune system to respond to infection. the irak-4 protein is part of a signaling pathway that is involved in early recognition of foreign invaders (pathogens) and the initiation of inflammation to fight infection. this signaling pathway is part of the innate immune response, which is the body's early, nonspecific response to pathogens.  mutations in the irak4 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein or no protein at all. the loss of functional irak-4 protein prevents the immune system from triggering inflammation in response to pathogens that would normally help fight the infections. because the early immune response is insufficient, bacterial infections occur often and become severe and invasive."

is rett syndrome inherited ?,"in more than 99 percent of people with rett syndrome, there is no history of the disorder in their family. many of these cases result from new mutations in the mecp2 gene.  a few families with more than one affected family member have been described. these cases helped researchers determine that classic rett syndrome and variants caused by mecp2 gene mutations have an x-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.  males with mutations in the mecp2 gene often die in infancy. however, a small number of males with a genetic change involving mecp2 have developed signs and symptoms similar to those of rett syndrome, including intellectual disability, seizures, and movement problems. in males, this condition is described as mecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy."
how to diagnose diabetic mastopathy ?,"how is diabetic mastopathy diagnosed? the diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy should be considered in patients with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes and a firm, mobile breast mass. initial imaging may include mammography and ultrasound. while these methods can help to further differentiate the mass, they cannot provide a specific diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy with confident exclusion of malignancy. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is unlikely to add additional information. current practice dictates that a core biopsy (utilizing a needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue) be performed for a definitive diagnosis.  biopsy results demonstrate lymphocytic lobulitis and ductitis, glandular atrophy (wasting), perivascular inflammation (vasculitis), dense keloid fibrosis (scarring), and epithelioid fibroblasts."

what is (are) osteopetrosis ?,"osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage (fracture). researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked. the different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms.  autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ado), which is also called albers-schnberg disease, is typically the mildest type of the disorder. some affected individuals have no symptoms. in these people, the unusually dense bones may be discovered by accident when an x-ray is done for another reason. in affected individuals who develop signs and symptoms, the major features of the condition include multiple bone fractures, abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or other spinal abnormalities, arthritis in the hips, and a bone infection called osteomyelitis. these problems usually become apparent in late childhood or adolescence.  autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (aro) is a more severe form of the disorder that becomes apparent in early infancy. affected individuals have a high risk of bone fracture resulting from seemingly minor bumps and falls. their abnormally dense skull bones pinch nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves), often resulting in vision loss, hearing loss, and paralysis of facial muscles. dense bones can also impair the function of bone marrow, preventing it from producing new blood cells and immune system cells. as a result, people with severe osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and recurrent infections. in the most severe cases, these bone marrow abnormalities can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood.  other features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can include slow growth and short stature, dental abnormalities, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). depending on the genetic changes involved, people with severe osteopetrosis can also have brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, or recurrent seizures (epilepsy).  a few individuals have been diagnosed with intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis (iao), a form of the disorder that can have either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. the signs and symptoms of this condition become noticeable in childhood and include an increased risk of bone fracture and anemia. people with this form of the disorder typically do not have life-threatening bone marrow abnormalities. however, some affected individuals have had abnormal calcium deposits (calcifications) in the brain, intellectual disability, and a form of kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis.  rarely, osteopetrosis can have an x-linked pattern of inheritance. in addition to abnormally dense bones, the x-linked form of the disorder is characterized by abnormal swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema) and a condition called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. affected individuals also have a malfunctioning immune system (immunodeficiency), which allows severe, recurrent infections to develop. researchers often refer to this condition as ol-eda-id, an acronym derived from each of the major features of the disorder."
what is (are) menkes disease ?,"menkes disease is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. it is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to thrive; and progressive deterioration of the nervous system. additional signs and symptoms may be present. children with menkes syndrome typically begin to develop very severe symptoms during infancy. occipital horn syndrome is one of the less severe forms of menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. menkes disease is caused by mutations in the atp7a gene. it is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. early treatment with copper may slightly improve the prognosis in some affected children."
what is (are) coloboma ?,"coloboma is an eye abnormality that occurs before birth. colobomas are missing pieces of tissue in structures that form the eye. they may appear as notches or gaps in one of several parts of the eye, including the colored part of the eye called the iris; the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye; the blood vessel layer under the retina called the choroid; or the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain.  colobomas may be present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and location, can affect a person's vision. colobomas affecting the iris, which result in a ""keyhole"" appearance of the pupil, generally do not lead to vision loss. colobomas involving the retina result in vision loss in specific parts of the visual field, generally the upper part. large retinal colobomas or those affecting the optic nerve can cause low vision, which means vision loss that cannot be completely corrected with glasses or contact lenses.  some people with coloboma also have a condition called microphthalmia. in this condition, one or both eyeballs are abnormally small. in some affected individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing; however, even in these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. such severe microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. however, the terms anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. microphthalmia may or may not result in significant vision loss.  people with coloboma may also have other eye abnormalities, including clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract), increased pressure inside the eye (glaucoma) that can damage the optic nerve, vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), or separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment).  some individuals have coloboma as part of a syndrome that affects other organs and tissues in the body. these forms of the condition are described as syndromic. when coloboma occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or isolated.  colobomas involving the eyeball should be distinguished from gaps that occur in the eyelids. while these eyelid gaps are also called colobomas, they arise from abnormalities in different structures during early development."

what is (are) menkes disease ?,"menkes disease is caused by a defective gene named atpta1 that regulates the metabolism of copper in the body. the disease primarily affects male infants. copper accumulates at abnormally low levels in the liver and brain, but at higher than normal levels in the kidney and intestinal lining. affected infants may be born prematurely, but appear healthy at birth and develop normally for 6 to 8 weeks. then symptoms begin, including floppy muscle tone, seizures, and failure to thrive. menkes disease is also characterized by subnormal body temperature and strikingly peculiar hair, which is kinky, colorless or steel-colored, and breaks easily. there is often extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. arteries in the brain may be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. this can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures."

is dyskeratosis congenita inherited ?,"dyskeratosis congenita can have different inheritance patterns.  when dyskeratosis congenita is caused by dkc1 gene mutations, it is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the dkc1 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  when dyskeratosis congenita is caused by mutations in other genes, it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. autosomal dominant means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. autosomal recessive means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ?,"progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) is a disease of the white matter of the brain, caused by a virus infection that targets cells that make myelin--the material that insulates nerve cells (neurons). polyomavirus jc (often called jc virus) is carried by a majority of people and is harmless except among those with lowered immune defenses. the disease is rare and occurs in patients undergoing chronic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, or individuals with cancer (such as hodgkins disease or lymphoma). individuals with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis -- some of whom are treated with biological therapies that allow jc virus reactivation -- are at risk for pml as well. pml is most common among individuals with hiv-1 infection / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). studies estimate that prior to effective antiretroviral therapy, as many as 5 percent of persons infected with hiv-1 eventually develop pml that is an aids-defining illness. however, current hiv therapy using antiretroviral drugs (art), which effectively restores immune system function, allows as many as half of all hiv-pml patients to survive, although they may sometimes have an inflammatory reaction in the regions of the brain affected by pml. the symptoms of pml are diverse, since they are related to the location and amount of damage in the brain, and may evolve over the course of several weeks to months the most prominent symptoms are clumsiness; progressive weakness; and visual, speech, and sometimes personality changes. the progression of deficits leads to life-threatening disability and (frequently) death. a diagnosis of pml can be made following brain biopsy or by combining observations of a progressive course of the disease, consistent white matter lesions visible on a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan, and the detection of the jc virus in spinal fluid."
what are the stages of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone ?,"key points
                    - after osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (mfh) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - osteosarcoma and mfh are described as either localized or metastatic.
                
                
                    after osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (mfh) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. for osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (mfh), most patients are grouped according to whether cancer is found in only one part of the body or has spread.    the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   x-ray : an x-ray of the organs, such as the chest, and bones inside the body. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. x-rays will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed.    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. pictures will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed.    -   pet-ct scan : a procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (pet) scan and a computed tomography (ct) scan. the pet and ct scans are done at the same time on the same machine. the pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. a pet scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if osteosarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually osteosarcoma cells. the disease is metastatic osteosarcoma, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    osteosarcoma and mfh are described as either localized or metastatic.
                    -  localized osteosarcoma or mfh has not spread out of the bone where the cancer started. there may be one or more areas of cancer in the bone that can be removed during surgery.    - metastatic osteosarcoma or mfh has spread from the bone in which the cancer began to other parts of the body. the cancer most often spreads to the lungs. it may also spread to other bones."

what are the treatments for marfan syndrome ?,"marfan syndrome has no cure. however, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early.
                
marfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. the type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms.
                
heart treatments
                
aortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to marfan syndrome. in this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak.
                
medicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears.
                
if you have marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta.
                
medicines
                
beta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. these medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation.
                
some people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). if side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ace inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta.
                
studies suggest that blocking a protein called tgf-beta may help prevent some of the effects of marfan syndrome. research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions.
                
the national heart, lung, and blood institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have marfan syndrome. the study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation.
                
surgery
                
if your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). to prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta.
                
surgery may involve:
                
a composite valve graft. for this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. the aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. a man-made valve replaces the original valve.
                
aortic valve-sparing surgery. if your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. for this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. your aortic valve is left in place.
                
after aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. for example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners.""
                
blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. you'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. if you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes.
                
if you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (en-do-kar-di-tis). this is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis.
                
your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery.
                
after surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or cardiac computed tomography (ct) scans to check your aorta.
                
cardiac mri is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. cardiac ct is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart.
                
bone and joint treatments
                
if you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery.
                
some people who have marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. this surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart.
                
eye treatments
                
marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens).
                
glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. sometimes surgery is needed.
                
nervous system treatments
                
marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. in this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. this can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines.
                
lung treatments
                
marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. in this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall.
                
if the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. however, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. sometimes surgery is needed."

what is (are) deep vein thrombosis ?,"espaol
                
deep vein thrombosis (throm-bo-sis), or dvt, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together.
                
most deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. they also can occur in other parts of the body.
                
a blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. the loose clot is called an embolus (em-bo-lus). it can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. this condition is called pulmonary embolism (pull-mun-ary em-bo-lizm), or pe.
                
pe is a very serious condition. it can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death.
                
blood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause pe than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface. however, these clots won't break off and cause pe.

what is (are) complex regional pain syndrome ?,"complex regional pain syndrome (crps) is a chronic pain condition. it causes intense pain, usually in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. it may happen after an injury, either to a nerve or to tissue in the affected area. rest and time may only make it worse.    symptoms in the affected area are       - dramatic changes in skin temperature, color, or texture    - intense burning pain    - extreme skin sensitivity    - swelling and stiffness in affected joints    - decreased ability to move the affected body part       the cause of crps is unknown. there is no specific diagnostic test. your doctor will diagnose crps based on your signs and symptoms.    there is no cure. it can get worse over time, and may spread to other parts of the body. occasionally it goes away, either temporarily or for good. treatment focuses on relieving the pain, and can include medicines, physical therapy, and nerve blocks.    nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke"
what are the symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans? bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by a dry cough and shortness of breath which develop 2 to 8 weeks after toxic fume exposure or a respiratory illness. fatigue and wheezing in the absence of a cold or asthma may also be noted. while high resolution chest ct scans and pulmonary function tests may help to detect bronchiolitis obliterans, a surgical lung biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the disease."
what are the treatments for hypoglycemia ?,"signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person. people with diabetes should get to know their signs and symptoms and describe them to their friends and family so they can help if needed. school staff should be told how to recognize a child's signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it.
                
people who experience hypoglycemia several times in a week should call their health care provider. they may need a change in their treatment plan: less medication or a different medication, a new schedule for insulin or medication, a different meal plan, or a new physical activity plan.
                
prompt treatment for hypoglycemia
                
when people think their blood glucose is too low, they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter. if the level is below 70 mg/dl, one of these quick-fix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose:
                
- 3 or 4 glucose tablets  - 1 serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrate  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of any fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnot dietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey
                
recommended amounts may be less for small children. the child's doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child.
                
the next step is to recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 mg/dl or above. if it's still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be eaten. these steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dl or above. if the next meal is an hour or more away, a snack should be eaten once the quick-fix foods have raised the blood glucose level to 70 mg/dl or above.
                
for people who take acarbose (precose) or miglitol (glyset)
                
people who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose, also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode. other quick-fix foods and drinks won't raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate.
                
help from others for severe hypoglycemia
                
severe hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening. severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type 1 diabetes. people should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia. another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon. glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness. a health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. family, friends, or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call 911 or get medical help.
                
physical activity and blood glucose levels
                
physical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes, including lowering blood glucose levels. however, physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to 24 hours afterward. a health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise. for those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production, the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below 100 mg/dl or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia. a snack can prevent hypoglycemia. the health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks, especially after strenuous exercise.
                
hypoglycemia when driving
                
hypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving. people with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers. to prevent problems, people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving. during longer trips, they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at 70 mg/dl or above. if necessary, they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is 70 mg/dl or above before starting to drive again.
                
hypoglycemia unawareness
                
some people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. this condition occurs most often in people with type 1 diabetes, but it can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes. people with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to check their blood glucose level more often so they know when hypoglycemia is about to occur. they also may need a change in their medications, meal plan, or physical activity routine.
                
hypoglycemia unawareness develops when frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to changes in how the body reacts to low blood glucose levels. the body stops releasing the hormone epinephrine and other stress hormones when blood glucose drops too low. the loss of the body's ability to release stress hormones after repeated episodes of hypoglycemia is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, or haaf.
                
epinephrine causes early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shakiness, sweating, anxiety, and hunger. without the release of epinephrine and the symptoms it causes, a person may not realize that hypoglycemia is occurring and may not take action to treat it. a vicious cycle can occur in which frequent hypoglycemia leads to hypoglycemia unawareness and haaf, which in turn leads to even more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia. studies have shown that preventing hypoglycemia for a period as short as several weeks can sometimes break this cycle and restore awareness of symptoms. health care providers may therefore advise people who have had severe hypoglycemia to aim for higher-than-usual blood glucose targets for short-term periods.
                
being prepared for hypoglycemia
                
people who use insulin or take an oral diabetes medication that can cause low blood glucose should always be prepared to prevent and treat low blood glucose by
                
- learning what can trigger low blood glucose levels  - having their blood glucose meter available to test glucose levels; frequent testing may be critical for those with hypoglycemia unawareness, particularly before driving a car or engaging in any hazardous activity  - always having several servings of quick-fix foods or drinks handy  - wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace  - planning what to do if they develop severe hypoglycemia  - telling their family, friends, and coworkers about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how they can help if needed
                
normal and target blood glucose ranges          normal blood glucose levels in people who do not have diabetes          upon wakingfasting    70 to 99 mg/dl        after meals    70 to 140 mg/dl          target blood glucose levels in people who have diabetes          before meals    70 to 130 mg/dl        1 to 2 hours after the start of a meal    below 180 mg/dl
                
for people with diabetes, a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dl is considered hypoglycemia."

is warsaw breakage syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what causes hemochromatosis ?,"what causes hemochromatosis? the underlying cause of hemochromatosis depends on whether a person has a hereditary form, an acquired form, or the neonatal form. hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in any of several genes: type 1 hemochromatosis - the hfe gene type 2 hemochromatosis - either the hfe2 or hamp gene type 3 hemochromatosis - the tfr2 gene type 4 hemochromatosis - the slc40a1 gene these genes give the body instructions to make proteins that help regulate how iron is absorbed, transported, and stored. mutations in these genes impair how iron is absorbed during digestion and alter the distribution of iron throughout the body. this causes iron to accumulate in tissues and organs. acquired hemochromatosis (or secondary hemochromatosis) is usually due to other blood-related disorders, such as thalassemia or certain anemias, or having many blood transfusions. sometimes it occurs as a result of long-term alcoholism or other health conditions. the cause of neonatal hemochromatosis is not fully understood. however, a woman with an affected child has approximately an 80% chance to have another affected child. this likelihood of recurrence is not explained by normal inheritance patterns. therefore, this form appears to be familial, but not inherited."
is hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy inherited ?,"hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy caused by mutations in the app, cst3, or itm2b gene is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  there is also a non-hereditary form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy that occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. the cause of this form of the condition is unknown. these cases are described as sporadic and are not inherited."
what causes pyruvate kinase deficiency ?,"what causes pyruvate kinase deficiency? in most cases, pyruvate kinase deficiency is caused by mutations in the pklr gene. more than 100 different mutation in the pklr gene have been detected. medical conditions, such as acute leukemia, preleukemia, and refractory sideroblastic anemia, as well as complications from chemotherapy, can cause an acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency. this type is more common and milder than the hereditary type."
what causes heart disease in women ?,"research suggests thatcoronary heart disease(chd) begins with damage to the lining and inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. several factors contribute to this damage. they include:
                
smoking, including secondhand smoke
                
high amounts of certain fats andcholesterol in the blood
                
high blood pressure
                
high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes
                
blood vessel inflammation
                
plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.
                
over time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. this can cause chest pain or discomfort calledangina.
                
if the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (plate-lets) stick to the site of the injury. they may clump together to form blood clots.
                
blood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsenangina. if a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack.
                
in addition to the factors above, low estrogen levels before or after menopause may play a role in causingcoronary microvascular disease(mvd). coronary mvd is heart disease that affects the heart's tiny arteries.
                
the cause of broken heart syndrome isn't yet known. however, a sudden release of stress hormones may play a role in causing the disorder. most cases of broken heart syndrome occur in women who have gone through menopause."
what is (are) treacher collins syndrome ?,"treacher collins syndrome (tcs) is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. the signs and symptoms vary greatly, ranging from almost unnoticeable to severe. most affected people have underdeveloped facial bones, particularly the cheek bones, and a very small jaw and chin (micrognathia). other features may include cleft palate, eye abnormalities, and hearing loss. tcs may be caused by mutations in the tcof1, polr1c, or polr1d genes. when the tcof1 or polr1d gene is responsible, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. however, about 60% of autosomal dominant cases are due to a new mutation in the gene and are not inherited from a parent. when the polr1c gene is responsible, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. in some cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown."
what are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? ankylosing spondylitis (as) primarily affects the spine, but may affect other parts of the body too. signs and symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood and include back pain and stiffness. back movement gradually becomes more limited over time as the vertebrae fuse together. many affected people have mild back pain that comes and goes; others have severe, chronic pain. in very severe cases, the rib cage may become stiffened, making it difficult to breathe deeply. in some people, the condition involves other areas of the body, such as the shoulders, hips, knees, and/or the small joints of the hands and feet. it may affect various places where tendons and ligaments attach to the bones. sometimes it can affect other organs including the eyes, and very rarely, the heart and lungs. episodes of eye inflammation may cause eye pain and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). neurological complications of as may include an inability to control urination and bowel movements (incontinence), and the absence of normal reflexes in the ankles due to pressure on the lower portion of the spinal cord (cauda equina). the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for ankylosing spondylitis. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% abnormality of the oral cavity 90% abnormality of the sacroiliac joint 90% arthralgia 90% arthritis 90% diarrhea 90% enthesitis 90% inflammatory abnormality of the eye 90% joint swelling 90% spinal rigidity 90% abnormality of the thorax 50% myalgia 50% respiratory insufficiency 50% abdominal pain 7.5% abnormal tendon morphology 7.5% abnormality of temperature regulation 7.5% abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% abnormality of the pleura 7.5% anorexia 7.5% arrhythmia 7.5% autoimmunity 7.5% cartilage destruction 7.5% hematuria 7.5% hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% hyperkeratosis 7.5% nephrolithiasis 7.5% nephropathy 7.5% nephrotic syndrome 7.5% osteomyelitis 7.5% proteinuria 7.5% pulmonary fibrosis 7.5% pustule 7.5% recurrent fractures 7.5% recurrent urinary tract infections 7.5% renal insufficiency 7.5% skin rash 7.5% skin ulcer 7.5% anterior uveitis - aortic regurgitation - back pain - hip osteoarthritis - inflammation of the large intestine - kyphosis - multifactorial inheritance - psoriasis - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what are the treatments for gastritis ?,"health care providers treat gastritis with medications to
                
- reduce the amount of acid in the stomach  - treat the underlying cause
                
reduce the amount of acid in the stomach
                
the stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. medications that reduce acid include
                
- antacids, such as alka-seltzer, maalox, mylanta, rolaids, and riopan. many brands use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, aluminum, and calciumalong with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. antacids, however, can have side effects. magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. calcium carbonate antacids, such as tums, titralac, and alka-2, can cause constipation.  - h2 blockers, such as cimetidine (tagamet hb), famotidine (pepcid ac), nizatidine (axid ar), and ranitidine (zantac 75). h2 blockers decrease acid production. they are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths.  - proton pump inhibitors (ppis) include omeprazole (prilosec, zegerid), lansoprazole (prevacid), dexlansoprazole (dexilant), pantoprazole (protonix), rabeprazole (aciphex), and esomeprazole (nexium). ppis decrease acid production more effectively than h2 blockers. all of these medications are available by prescription. omeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter strength.
                
treat the underlying cause
                
depending on the cause of gastritis, a health care provider may recommend additional treatments.
                
- treating h. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection. curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, malt lymphoma, and gastric cancer.  - avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. for example, if prolonged nsaid use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the nsaids, reduce the dose, or change pain medications.  - health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (carafate), h2 blockers, and ppis. treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis.  - health care providers may treat people with pernicious anemia due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis with vitamin b12 injections."
what is (are) familial erythrocytosis ?,"familial erythrocytosis is an inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells (erythrocytes). the primary function of these cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body. signs and symptoms of familial erythrocytosis can include headaches, dizziness, nosebleeds, and shortness of breath. the excess red blood cells also increase the risk of developing abnormal blood clots that can block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. if these clots restrict blood flow to essential organs and tissues (particularly the heart, lungs, or brain), they can cause life-threatening complications such as a heart attack or stroke. however, many people with familial erythrocytosis experience only mild signs and symptoms or never have any problems related to their extra red blood cells."
what are the genetic changes related to moebius syndrome ?,"the causes of moebius syndrome are unknown, although the condition probably results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. researchers are working to identify and describe specific genes related to this condition. the disorder appears to be associated with changes in particular regions of chromosomes 3, 10, or 13 in some families. certain medications taken during pregnancy and abuse of drugs such as cocaine may also be risk factors for moebius syndrome.  many of the signs and symptoms of moebius syndrome result from the absence or underdevelopment of cranial nerves vi and vii. these nerves, which emerge from the brainstem at the back of the brain, control back-and-forth eye movement and facial expressions. the disorder can also affect other cranial nerves that are important for speech, chewing, and swallowing. abnormal development of cranial nerves leads to the facial muscle weakness or paralysis that is characteristic of moebius syndrome.  researchers speculate that moebius syndrome may result from changes in blood flow to the brainstem during early stages of embryonic development. however, it is unclear what causes these changes to occur and why they specifically disrupt the development of cranial nerves vi and vii. even less is known about the causes of some other signs and symptoms of this condition, including hand and foot abnormalities."

what is (are) frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 ?,"frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (ftdp-17) is a progressive brain disorder that affects behavior, language, and movement. the symptoms of this disorder usually become noticeable in a person's forties or fifties. most affected people survive 5 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, although a few have survived for two decades or more.  changes in personality and behavior are often early signs of ftdp-17. these changes include a loss of inhibition, inappropriate emotional responses, restlessness, neglect of personal hygiene, and a general loss of interest in activities and events. the disease also leads to deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia), including problems with judgment, planning, and concentration. some people with ftdp-17 develop psychiatric symptoms, including obsessive-compulsive behaviors, delusions, and hallucinations. it may become difficult for affected individuals to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. they increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living.  many people with ftdp-17 develop problems with speech and language. they may have trouble finding words, confuse one word with another (semantic paraphasias), and repeat words spoken by others (echolalia). difficulties with speech and language worsen over time, and most affected individuals eventually lose the ability to communicate.  ftdp-17 is also characterized by progressive problems with movement. many affected individuals develop features of parkinsonism, including tremors, rigidity, and unusually slow movement (bradykinesia). as the disease progresses, most affected individuals become unable to walk. some people with ftdp-17 also have restricted up-and-down eye movement (vertical gaze palsy) and rapid abnormal movements of both eyes (saccades)."
do you have information about pancreas transplantation,"summary : the pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. it produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. a pancreas transplant is surgery to place a healthy pancreas from a donor into a person with a diseased pancreas. it is mostly done for people with severe type 1 diabetes. it can allow them to give up insulin shots. an experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.    people who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives. they must also have regular follow-up care. because of the risks, it is not a common treatment for type 1 diabetes."
is restless legs syndrome inherited ?,"the inheritance pattern of restless legs syndrome is usually unclear because many genetic and environmental factors can be involved. the disorder often runs in families: 40 to 90 percent of affected individuals report having at least one affected first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, and many families have multiple affected family members. studies suggest that the early-onset form of the disorder is more likely to run in families than the late-onset form.  in some affected families, restless legs syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. however, the genetic changes associated with restless legs syndrome in these families have not been identified."

what is the outlook for arachnoid cysts ?,"untreated, arachnoid cysts may cause permanent severe neurological damage when progressive expansion of the cyst(s) or bleeding into the cyst injures the brain or spinal cord. symptoms usually resolve or improve with treatment."
who is at risk for cataract? ?,"as with any surgery, cataract surgery poses risks such as infection and bleeding. before cataract surgery, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop taking certain medications that increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. after surgery, you must keep your eye clean, wash your hands before touching your eye, and use the prescribed medications to help minimize the risk of infection. serious infection can result in loss of vision. cataract surgery slightly increases your risk of retinal detachment. other eye disorders, such as nearsightedness, can further increase your risk of retinal detachment after cataract surgery. a retinal detachment causes no pain. early treatment for retinal detachment often can prevent permanent loss of vision. the longer the retina stays detached, the less likely you will regain good vision once you are treated. even if you are treated promptly, some vision may be lost. talk to your eye care professional about these risks. make sure cataract surgery is right for you."
what are the genetic changes related to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in the dpyd gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of molecules called uracil and thymine. uracil and thymine are pyrimidines, which are one type of nucleotide. nucleotides are building blocks of dna, its chemical cousin rna, and molecules such as atp and gtp that serve as energy sources in the cell.  mutations in the dpyd gene result in a lack (deficiency) of functional dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency interferes with the breakdown of uracil and thymine, and results in excess quantities of these molecules in the blood, urine, and the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). it is unclear how the excess uracil and thymine are related to the specific signs and symptoms of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. mutations that result in the absence (complete deficiency) of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase generally lead to more severe signs and symptoms than do mutations that lead to a partial deficiency of this enzyme.  because fluoropyrimidine drugs are also broken down by the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme, deficiency of this enzyme leads to the drug buildup that causes fluoropyrimidine toxicity."
what are the genetic changes related to graves disease ?,"graves disease is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown.  graves disease is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. in people with graves disease, the immune system creates a protein (antibody) called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi). tsi signals the thyroid to increase its production of hormones abnormally. the resulting overactivity of the thyroid causes many of the signs and symptoms of graves disease. studies suggest that immune system abnormalities also underlie graves ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema.  people with graves disease have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, addison disease, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo.  variations in many genes have been studied as possible risk factors for graves disease. some of these genes are part of a family called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). other genes that have been associated with graves disease help regulate the immune system or are involved in normal thyroid function. most of the genetic variations that have been discovered are thought to have a small impact on a person's overall risk of developing this condition.  other, nongenetic factors are also believed to play a role in graves disease. these factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), viral or bacterial infections, certain medications, and having too much or too little iodine (a substance critical for thyroid hormone production). smoking increases the risk of eye problems and is associated with more severe eye abnormalities in people with graves disease."
is pyle disease inherited ?,"is pyle disease inherited? pyle disease in inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they often don't have any signs and symptoms of the condition. some carriers (obligate heterozygotes) of pyle disease show minor skeletal changes."
what are the treatments for high blood pressure ?,"based on your diagnosis, health care providers develop treatment plans for high blood pressure that include lifelong lifestyle changes and medicines to control high blood pressure; lifestyle changes such as weight loss can be highly effective in treating high blood pressure.
                

                
treatment plans
                
health care providers work with you to develop a treatment plan based on whether you were diagnosed with primary or secondary high blood pressure and if there is a suspected or known cause. treatment plans may evolve until blood pressure control is achieved.
                
if your health care provider diagnoses you with secondary high blood pressure, he or she will work to treat the other condition or change the medicine suspected of causing your high blood pressure. if high blood pressure persists or is first diagnosed as primary high blood pressure, your treatment plan will include lifestyle changes. when lifestyle changes alone do not control or lower blood pressure, your health care provider may change or update your treatment plan by prescribing medicines to treat the disease. health care providers prescribe children and teens medicines at special doses that are safe and effective in children.
                
if your health care provider prescribes medicines as a part of your treatment plan, keep up your healthy lifestyle habits. the combination of the medicines and the healthy lifestyle habits helps control and lower your high blood pressure.
                
some people develop resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure. this can happen when the medications they are taking do not work well for them or another medical condition is leading to uncontrolled blood pressure. health care providers treat resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure with an intensive treatment plan that can include a different set of blood pressure medications or other special treatments.
                
to achieve the best control of your blood pressure, follow your treatment plan and take all medications as prescribed. following your prescribed treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay complications that high blood pressure can cause and can lower your risk for other related problems.
                

                
healthy lifestyle changes
                
healthy lifestyle habits can help you control high blood pressure. these habits include:
                
healthy eating
                
being physically active
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
limiting alcohol intake
                
managing and coping with stress
                
to help make lifelong lifestyle changes, try making one healthy lifestyle change at a time and add another change when you feel that you have successfully adopted the earlier changes. when you practice several healthy lifestyle habits, you are more likely to lower your blood pressure and maintain normal blood pressure readings.
                

                
healthy eating
                
to help treat high blood pressure, health care providers recommend that you limit sodium and salt intake, increase potassium, and eat foods that are heart healthy.
                
limiting sodium and salt
                
a low-sodium diet can help you manage your blood pressure. you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300 mg sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
your health care provider may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and salt.
                
the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about the dash eating plan.
                
heart-healthy eating
                
your health care provider also may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
whole grains
                
fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
a lot of red meat
                
palm and coconut oils
                
sugary foods and beverages
                
in the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)-sponsored hispanic community health study/study of latinos, which studied hispanics living in the united states, cubans ate more sodium and mexicans ate less sodium than other hispanic groups in the study. all hispanic americans should follow these healthy eating recommendations even when cooking traditional latino dishes. try some of these popular hispanic american heart-healthy recipes.
                

                
being physically active
                
routine physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise plan. ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week.

maintaining a healthy weight
                
maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3 to 5 percent can lower your risk for health problems. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lowerldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol. however, research shows that no matter your weight, it is important to control high blood pressure to maintain good health.
                
a useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (bmi). bmi measures your weight in relation to your height. to figure out your bmi, check out nhlbis online bmi calculator or talk to yourhealth care provider.
                
a bmi:
                
below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.
                
between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
a general goal to aim for is a bmi below 25. your health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal.
                
measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. this risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk. for more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to aim for a healthy weight.
                

                
limiting alcohol intake
                
limit alcohol intake. too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. one drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
managing and coping with stress
                
learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health and can lower high blood pressure. stress management techniques include:
                
being physically active
                
listening to music or focusing on something calm or peaceful
                
performing yoga or tai chi
                
meditating
                

                
medicines
                
blood pressure medicines work in different ways to stop or slow some of the bodys functions that cause high blood pressure. medicines to lower blood pressure include:
                
diuretics (water or fluid pills): flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.
                
beta blockers: help your heart beat slower and with less force. as a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure.
                
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors: angiotensin-ii is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ace converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii. ace inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of angiotensin ii, lowering blood pressure.
                
angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arbs): block angiotensin ii hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. when angiotensin ii is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.
                
calcium channel blockers: keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. this allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure.
                
alpha blockers: reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. this allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.
                
alpha-beta blockers: reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. however, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. as a result, blood pressure goes down.
                
central acting agents: act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.
                
vasodilators: relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.
                
to lower and control blood pressure, many people take two or more medicines. if you have side effects from your medicines, dont stop taking your medicines. instead, talk with your health care provider about the side effects to see if the dose can be changed or a new medicine prescribed.
                
future treatments
                
scientists, doctors, and researchers continue to study the changes that cause high blood pressure, to develop new medicines and treatments to control high blood pressure. possible future treatments under investigation include new combination medicines, vaccines, and interventions aimed at the sympathetic nervous system, such as kidney nerve ablation."
what causes epidermolysis bullosa acquisita ?,"what causes epidermolysis bullosa acquisita? the underlying cause of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (eba) is not known. it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, which means that the immune system attacks healthy cells by mistake. in eba, certain immune proteins (usually igg autoantibodies) mistakenly target and attack a specific type of collagen (a skin protein) involved in ""anchoring"" the skin. in some milder cases of eba, the immune proteins involved are thought to be iga, rather than igg autoantibodies. the initiating event that leads to autoantibody production is unknown. eba affecting several family members has been reported, suggesting a genetic component may be involved in some cases. rarely, people with lupus, a systemic autoimmune disease, develop a generalized blistering skin disease with the features of eba. eba has also been associated with crohn's disease."
what is (are) tourette syndrome ?,"tourette syndrome is a complex neurological disorder that is characterized by repetitive, sudden, uncontrolled (involuntary) movements and sounds (vocalizations) called tics. tourette syndrome is named for georges gilles de la tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. a variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing tourette syndrome. a small number of people with tourette syndrome have been found to have mutations involving the slitrk1 gene. the syndrome is believed to be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain, and the chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another. it is estimated that about 1% of the population has tourette syndrome. many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. although tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood."
what is (are) hiccups ?,"a hiccup is an unintentional movement of the diaphragm, the muscle at the base of the lungs. it's followed by quick closing of the vocal cords, which produces the ""hic"" sound you make. there are a large number of causes, including large meals, alcohol, or hot and spicy foods. hiccups may also start and stop for no obvious reason.    there is no sure way to stop hiccups. you can try       - breathing into a paper bag    - drinking or sipping a glass of cold water    - holding your breath       hiccups aren't usually serious. contact your health care provider if they last for more than a few days."
what is (are) distal myopathy 2 ?,"distal myopathy 2 is a condition characterized by weakness of specific muscles that begins in adulthood. it is a form of muscular dystrophy that specifically involves muscles in the throat, lower legs, and forearms. muscles farther from the center of the body, like the muscles of the lower legs and forearms, are known as distal muscles.  muscle weakness in the ankles is usually the first symptom of distal myopathy 2. the weakness can also affect muscles in the hands, wrists, and shoulders. at first, the muscle weakness may be on only one side of the body, but both sides are eventually involved. this muscle weakness can slowly worsen and make actions like walking and lifting the fingers difficult.  another characteristic feature of distal myopathy 2 is weakness of the vocal cords and throat. this weakness initially causes the voice to sound weak or breathy (hypophonic). eventually, the voice becomes gurgling, hoarse, and nasal. the weakness can also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)."
what is (are) high blood cholesterol ?,"your ldl goal is how low your ldl cholesterol level should be to reduce your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. the higher your risk, the lower your goal ldl should be. your doctor will set your ldl goal using your medical history and the number of risk factors that you have."
what are the symptoms of recurrent hydatidiform mole ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of recurrent hydatidiform mole? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for recurrent hydatidiform mole. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the genitourinary system - autosomal recessive inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) ainhum ?,"ainhum is the autoamputation of a finger or toe as a result of a fibrotic band that constricts the finger or toe until it falls off. ainhum most often affects the fifth toe on both feet. ainhum is believed to be triggered by some sort of trauma, but the exact reason why it happens is not well understood. the condition mainly affects people that live in tropical regions."
what are the treatments for cataract ?,"a cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities, such as driving, reading, or watching tv. you and your eye care professional can make this decision together. is surgery right for you? once you understand the benefits and risks of surgery, you can make an informed decision about whether cataract surgery is right for you. in most cases, delaying cataract surgery will not cause long-term damage to your eye or make the surgery more difficult. you do not have to rush into surgery. sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. for example, a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem, such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. if you choose surgery, your eye care professional may refer you to a specialist to remove the cataract. if you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery, the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times, usually four to eight weeks apart. cataract removal is one of the most common operations performed in the united states. it also is one of the safest and most effective types of surgery. in about 90 percent of cases, people who have cataract surgery have better vision afterward. types of cataract surgery there are two types of cataract surgery, phacoemulsification and extracapsular surgery. your doctor can explain the differences and help determine which is better for you. with phacoemulsification, or phaco, a small incision is made on the side of the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. your doctor inserts a tiny probe into the eye. this device emits ultrasound waves that soften and break up the lens so that it can be removed by suction. most cataract surgery today is done by phacoemulsification, also called small incision cataract surgery. with extracapsular surgery, your doctor makes a longer incision on the side of the cornea and removes the cloudy core of the lens in one piece. the rest of the lens is removed by suction. an artificial lens replaces the natural lens after the natural lens has been removed, it usually is replaced by an artificial lens, called an intraocular lens, or iol. an iol is a clear, plastic lens that requires no care and becomes a permanent part of your eye. light is focused clearly by the iol onto the retina, improving your vision. you will not feel or see the new lens. the operation usually lasts less than one hour and is almost painless. many people choose to stay awake during surgery. you can return quickly to many everyday activities, but your vision may be blurry. the healing eye needs time to adjust so that it can focus properly with the other eye, especially if the other eye has a cataract. ask your doctor when you can resume driving. wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataract. if you smoke, stop. researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataract. they recommend eating green leafy vegetables, fruit, and other foods with antioxidants. if you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. in addition to cataract, your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other vision disorders. for many eye diseases, early treatment may save your sight."

is partington syndrome inherited ?,"is partington syndrome inherited? partington syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive manner. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). women have two x chromosomes and men have an x and a y chromosome. in x-linked recessive conditions, men develop the condition if they inherit one gene mutation (they have only one x chromosome). females are generally only affected if they have two gene mutations (they have two x chromosomes), although some females may rarely have a mild form of the condition if they only inherit one mutation. a woman with an x-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. this means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers. a man with an x-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters (carriers) and none of his sons."
what are the treatments for cornelia de lange syndrome ?,"how might cornelia de lange syndrome be treated? because cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. for example, many people affected by cdls have poor growth after birth and may require supplemental formulas and/or gastrostomy tube placement to meet nutritional needs. ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapies are often recommended to optimize developmental potential. surgery may be necessary to treat skeletal abnormalities, gastrointestinal problems, congenital heart defects and other health problems. medications may be prescribed to prevent or control seizures. the cdls foundation's web site offers more specific information about the treatment and management of cdls. please click on the link to access this resource."
what are the symptoms of madelung disease ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of madelung disease? the signs and symptoms of madelung disease vary from person to person. the condition is characterized by the symmetric growth of fatty tumors (lipomas) around the neck, shoulders, upper arms and/or upper trunk. in some affected people, these fatty deposits may grow rapidly over the course of months, while others experience a slower progression over the course of years. the lipomas can be associated with significant physical deformity and may lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. in the majority of cases, the disease is benign; however, lipomas can become cancerous in rare circumstances. people with madelung disease may also develop peripheral neuropathy and neurological disturbances including difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, sleep problems, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), fluctuation in blood pressure, and breathing issues. in some cases, it may be associated with other metabolic abnormalities or diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and liver disease. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for madelung disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) arthralgia 90% limitation of joint mobility 90% multiple lipomas 90% gait disturbance 50% hepatomegaly 50% insulin resistance 50% paresthesia 50% abnormality of the skin - autosomal dominant inheritance - lipoma - peripheral neuropathy - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) hypersensitivity pneumonitis ?,"hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-ni-tis), or hp, is a disease in which the lungs become inflamed from breathing in foreign substances, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals. these substances also are known as antigens (an-tih-jens).
                
people are exposed to antigens at home, while at work, and in other settings. however, most people who breathe in these substances don't develop hp.
                
overview
                
to understand hp, it helps to understand how the lungs work. when you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. the air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. these sacs are called alveoli (al-vee-uhl-eye).
                
small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. when air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. the capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body.
                
in hp, the air sacs become inflamed and may fill with fluid. this makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sacs and into the bloodstream.
                
the two main types of hp are acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing). both types can develop as a result of repeatedly breathing in an antigen.
                
over time, your lungs can become sensitive to that antigen. if this happens, they'll become inflamed, which can lead to symptoms and may even cause long-term lung damage.
                
with acute hp, symptoms usually occur within 29 hours of exposure to an antigen you're sensitive to. acute hp can cause chills, body aches, coughing, and chest tightness. after hours or days of no contact with the antigen, symptoms usually go away.
                
if acute hp isn't found and treated early, chronic hp may develop. symptoms of chronic hp occur slowly, over months. chronic hp can cause a worsening cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss. severe hp may cause clubbing (a widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes).
                
with chronic hp, symptoms may continue and/or worsen, even after avoiding the antigen. sometimes, chronic hp can cause long-term lung damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis (pull-mun-ary fi-bro-sis). this is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.
                
outlook
                
avoiding or reducing your contact with antigens can help prevent and treat hp. for example, cleaning heating and ventilation filters can help reduce your contact with mold. wetting compost prior to handling it can reduce contact with harmful dust.
                
if hp is caught early, avoiding the antigen that caused it may be the only treatment you need. if you have chronic hp, your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce lung inflammation.
                
researchers continue to study why some people develop hp after being exposed to antigens, while others don't. they're also looking for better ways to quickly pinpoint which antigens are causing hp in people who are believed to have the disease."

what are the treatments for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis acquired ?,"how might acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis be treated? the treatment of pap varies from case to case depending upon the age of an affected individual and severity of the disease. approximately one-third of individuals with idiopathic pap (of unknown cause) will improve without treatment (spontaneous remission). the other two-thirds may be treated by a whole lung lavage, a procedure in which one lung is cleansed with a salt solution while the other is pumped with pure oxygen. in some cases, the procedure may need to be performed once; in others it may need to be repeated many times over several years. in secondary pap (due to environmental exposure or an underlying disorder), removal and avoidance of the causative agent (e.g., silica exposure) or treatment of the underlying disorder may improve symptoms. inhaled gm-csf (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a blood-stimulating medication, has been shown to improve the condition in some individuals with pap. lung transplantation has been used to treat adults with pap as a last resort. according to the medical literature, in some cases, pap has recurred in adults who have received lung transplantation."

what is (are) atrial fibrillation and stroke ?,"atrial fibrillation (af) describes the rapid, irregular beating of the left atrium (upper chamber) of the heart. these rapid contractions of the heart are weaker than normal contractions, resulting in slow flow of blood in the atrium. the blood pools and becomes sluggish and can result in the formation of blood clots. if a clot leaves the heart and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke by blocking the flow of blood through cerebral arteries. some people with af have no symptoms, but others may experience a fluttering feeling in the area of the chest above the heart, chest pain, lightheadness or fainting, shortness of breath, and fatigue. af is diagnosed by an electrocardiogram (ecg), a device that records the hearts electrical activity. other tests are often performed to rule out contributing causes, such as high blood pressure, an overactive thyroid gland, heart failure, faulty heart valves, lung disease, and stimulant or alcohol abuse. some people will have no identifiable cause for their af."
what is (are) mitral valve prolapse ?,"mitral valve prolapse (mvp) occurs when one of your heart's valves doesn't work properly. the flaps of the valve are ""floppy"" and don't close tightly. most people who have the condition are born with it. it also tends to run in families.    most of the time, mvp doesn't cause any problems. rarely, blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. this can cause       - palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast)    - shortness of breath    - cough    - fatigue, dizziness, or anxiety    - migraine headaches    - chest discomfort       most people who have mitral valve prolapse (mvp) don't need treatment because they don't have symptoms and complications. if you need treatment for mvp, medicines can help relieve symptoms or prevent complications. very few people will need surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.    mvp puts you at risk for infective endocarditis, a kind of heart infection. to prevent it, doctors used to prescribe antibiotics before dental work or certain surgeries. now, only people at high risk of endocarditis need the antibiotics.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"

what is (are) incontinentia pigmenti ?,"incontinentia pigmenti (ip) is an inherited disorder of skin pigmentation that is also associated with abnormalities of the teeth, skeletal system, eyes, and central nervous system. it is one of a group of gene-linked diseases known as neurocutaneous disorders. in most cases, ip is caused by mutations in a gene called nemo (nf-kappab essential modulator). males are more severely affected than females. discolored skin is caused by excessive deposits of melanin (normal skin pigment). most newborns with ip will develop discolored skin within the first two weeks. the pigmentation involves the trunk and extremities, is slate-grey, blue or brown, and is distributed in irregular marbled or wavy lines. the discoloration fades with age. neurological problems include loss of brain tissue (known as cerebral atrophy), the formation of small cavities in the central white matter of the brain, and the loss of neurons in the cerebellar cortex. about 20% of children with ip will have slow motor development, muscle weakness in one or both sides of the body, impaired cognitive development, and seizures. they are also likely to have visual problems, including crossed eyes, cataracts, and severe visual loss. dental problems are also common, including missing or peg-shaped teeth. a related disorder, incontinentia pigmenti achromians, features skin patterns of light, unpigmented swirls and streaks that are the reverse of ip. associated neurological problems are similar."

what are the genetic changes related to mucolipidosis iii gamma ?,"mutations in the gnptg gene cause mucolipidosis iii gamma. this gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called glcnac-1-phosphotransferase. this enzyme helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells. glcnac-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the process of attaching a molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (m6p) to specific digestive enzymes. just as luggage is tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination, enzymes are often ""tagged"" after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell. m6p acts as a tag that indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome.  mutations in the gnptg gene that cause mucolipidosis iii gamma result in reduced activity of glcnac-1-phosphotransferase. these mutations disrupt the tagging of digestive enzymes with m6p, which prevents many enzymes from reaching the lysosomes. digestive enzymes that do not receive the m6p tag end up outside the cell, where they have increased activity. the shortage of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there. conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis iii gamma, are called lysosomal storage disorders. the signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis iii gamma are most likely due to the shortage of digestive enzymes inside lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell."
what are the treatments for prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia ?,"treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia may include
                
- lifestyle changes  - medications  - minimally invasive procedures  - surgery
                
a health care provider treats benign prostatic hyperplasia based on the severity of symptoms, how much the symptoms affect a mans daily life, and a mans preferences.
                
men may not need treatment for a mildly enlarged prostate unless their symptoms are bothersome and affecting their quality of life. in these cases, instead of treatment, a urologist may recommend regular checkups. if benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms become bothersome or present a health risk, a urologist most often recommends treatment.
                
lifestyle changes
                
a health care provider may recommend lifestyle changes for men whose symptoms are mild or slightly bothersome. lifestyle changes can include
                
- reducing intake of liquids, particularly before going out in public or before periods of sleep  - avoiding or reducing intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol  - avoiding or monitoring the use of medications such as decongestants, antihistamines, antidepressants, and diuretics  - training the bladder to hold more urine for longer periods  - exercising pelvic floor muscles  - preventing or treating constipation
                
medications
                
a health care provider or urologist may prescribe medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or reduce symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia:
                
- alpha blockers  - phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  - 5-alpha reductase inhibitors  - combination medications
                
alpha blockers. these medications relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow and reduce bladder blockage:
                
- terazosin (hytrin)  - doxazosin (cardura)  - tamsulosin (flomax)  - alfuzosin (uroxatral)  - silodosin (rapaflo)
                
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. urologists prescribe these medications mainly for erectile dysfunction. tadalafil (cialis) belongs to this class of medications and can reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by relaxing smooth muscles in the lower urinary tract. researchers are working to determine the role of erectile dysfunction drugs in the long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
5-alpha reductase inhibitors. these medications block the production of dht, which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth:
                
- finasteride (proscar)  - dutasteride (avodart)
                
these medications can prevent progression of prostate growth or actually shrink the prostate in some men. finasteride and dutasteride act more slowly than alpha blockers and are useful for only moderately enlarged prostates.
                
combination medications. several studies, such as the medical therapy of prostatic symptoms (mtops) study, have shown that combining two classes of medications, instead of using just one, can more effectively improve symptoms, urinary flow, and quality of life. the combinations include
                
- finasteride and doxazosin  - dutasteride and tamsulosin (jalyn), a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet  - alpha blockers and antimuscarinics
                
a urologist may prescribe a combination of alpha blockers and antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms. overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence. antimuscarinics are a class of medications that relax the bladder muscles.
                
minimally invasive procedures
                
researchers have developed a number of minimally invasive procedures that relieve benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms when medications prove ineffective. these procedures include
                
- transurethral needle ablation  - transurethral microwave thermotherapy  - high-intensity focused ultrasound  - transurethral electrovaporization  - water-induced thermotherapy  - prostatic stent insertion
                
minimally invasive procedures can destroy enlarged prostate tissue or widen the urethra, which can help relieve blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
urologists perform minimally invasive procedures using the transurethral method, which involves inserting a cathetera thin, flexible tubeor cystoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate. these procedures may require local, regional, or general anesthesia. although destroying troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, tissue destruction does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia. a urologist will decide which procedure to perform based on the mans symptoms and overall health.
                
transurethral needle ablation. this procedure uses heat generated by radiofrequency energy to destroy prostate tissue. a urologist inserts a cystoscope through the urethra to the prostate. a urologist then inserts small needles through the end of the cystoscope into the prostate. the needles send radiofrequency energy that heats and destroys selected portions of prostate tissue. shields protect the urethra from heat damage.
                
transurethral microwave thermotherapy. this procedure uses microwaves to destroy prostate tissue. a urologist inserts a catheter through the urethra to the prostate, and a device called an antenna sends microwaves through the catheter to heat selected portions of the prostate. the temperature becomes high enough inside the prostate to destroy enlarged tissue. a cooling system protects the urinary tract from heat damage during the procedure.
                
high-intensity focused ultrasound. for this procedure, a urologist inserts a special ultrasound probe into the rectum, near the prostate. ultrasound waves from the probe heat and destroy enlarged prostate tissue.
                
transurethral electrovaporization. for this procedure, a urologist inserts a tubelike instrument called a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate. an electrode attached to the resectoscope moves across the surface of the prostate and transmits an electric current that vaporizes prostate tissue. the vaporizing effect penetrates below the surface area being treated and seals blood vessels, which reduces the risk of bleeding.
                
water-induced thermotherapy. this procedure uses heated water to destroy prostate tissue. a urologist inserts a catheter into the urethra so that a treatment balloon rests in the middle of the prostate. heated water flows through the catheter into the treatment balloon, which heats and destroys the surrounding prostate tissue. the treatment balloon can target a specific region of the prostate, while surrounding tissues in the urethra and bladder remain protected.
                
prostatic stent insertion. this procedure involves a urologist inserting a small device called a prostatic stent through the urethra to the area narrowed by the enlarged prostate. once in place, the stent expands like a spring, and it pushes back the prostate tissue, widening the urethra. prostatic stents may be temporary or permanent. urologists generally use prostatic stents in men who may not tolerate or be suitable for other procedures.
                
surgery
                
for long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, a urologist may recommend removing enlarged prostate tissue or making cuts in the prostate to widen the urethra. urologists recommend surgery when
                
- medications and minimally invasive procedures are ineffective  - symptoms are particularly bothersome or severe  - complications arise
                
although removing troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, tissue removal does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
surgery to remove enlarged prostate tissue includes
                
- transurethral resection of the prostate (turp)  - laser surgery  - open prostatectomy  - transurethral incision of the prostate (tuip)
                
a urologist performs these surgeries, except for open prostatectomy, using the transurethral method. men who have these surgical procedures require local, regional, or general anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital.
                
the urologist may prescribe antibiotics before or soon after surgery to prevent infection. some urologists prescribe antibiotics only when an infection occurs.
                
immediately after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery, a urologist may insert a special catheter, called a foley catheter, through the opening of the penis to drain urine from the bladder into a drainage pouch.
                
turp. with turp, a urologist inserts a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate and cuts pieces of enlarged prostate tissue with a wire loop. special fluid carries the tissue pieces into the bladder, and the urologist flushes them out at the end of the procedure. turp is the most common surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia and considered the gold standard for treating blockage of the urethra due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.
                
laser surgery. with this surgery, a urologist uses a high-energy laser to destroy prostate tissue. the urologist uses a cystoscope to pass a laser fiber through the urethra into the prostate. the laser destroys the enlarged tissue. the risk of bleeding is lower than in turp and tuip because the laser seals blood vessels as it cuts through the prostate tissue. however, laser surgery may not effectively treat greatly enlarged prostates.
                
open prostatectomy. in an open prostatectomy, a urologist makes an incision, or cut, through the skin to reach the prostate. the urologist can remove all or part of the prostate through the incision. this surgery is used most often when the prostate is greatly enlarged, complications occur, or the bladder is damaged and needs repair. open prostatectomy requires general anesthesia, a longer hospital stay than other surgical procedures for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a longer rehabilitation period. the three open prostatectomy procedures are retropubic prostatectomy, suprapubic prostatectomy, and perineal prostatectomy. the recovery period for open prostatectomy is different for each man who undergoes the procedure. however, it typically takes anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks.4
                
tuip. a tuip is a surgical procedure to widen the urethra. during a tuip, the urologist inserts a cystoscope and an instrument that uses an electric current or a laser beam through the urethra to reach the prostate. the urologist widens the urethra by making a few small cuts in the prostate and in the bladder neck. some urologists believe that tuip gives the same relief as turp except with less risk of side effects.
                
after surgery, the prostate, urethra, and surrounding tissues may be irritated and swollen, causing urinary retention. to prevent urinary retention, a urologist inserts a foley catheter so urine can drain freely out of the bladder. a foley catheter has a balloon on the end that the urologist inserts into the bladder. once the balloon is inside the bladder, the urologist fills it with sterile water to keep the catheter in place. men who undergo minimally invasive procedures may not need a foley catheter.
                
the foley catheter most often remains in place for several days. sometimes, the foley catheter causes recurring, painful, difficult-to-control bladder spasms the day after surgery. however, these spasms will eventually stop. a urologist may prescribe medications to relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms. these medications include
                
- oxybutynin chloride (ditropan)  - solifenacin (vesicare)  - darifenacin (enablex)  - tolterodine (detrol)  - hyoscyamine (levsin)  - propantheline bromide (pro-banthine)"

what are the genetic changes related to beta-ketothiolase deficiency ?,"mutations in the acat1 gene cause beta-ketothiolase deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energy-producing centers within cells (mitochondria). this enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. specifically, the acat1 enzyme helps process isoleucine, which is a building block of many proteins, and ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats.  mutations in the acat1 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the acat1 enzyme. a shortage of this enzyme prevents the body from processing proteins and fats properly. as a result, related compounds can build up to toxic levels in the blood. these substances cause the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis), which can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly in the nervous system."
what are the treatments for male breast cancer ?,"key points
                    - there are different types of treatment for men with breast cancer.    - five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with breast cancer:         - surgery      - chemotherapy      - hormone therapy      - radiation therapy     - targeted therapy        - treatment for male breast cancer may cause side effects.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for men with breast cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for men with breast cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.   some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with breast cancer:
                    surgery      surgery for men with breast cancer is usually a modified radical mastectomy (removal of the breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes part of the chest wall muscles).         breast-conserving surgery, an operation to remove the cancer but not the breast itself, is also used for some men with breast cancer. a lumpectomy is done to remove the tumor (lump) and a small amount of normal tissue around it. radiation therapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.          chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.       hormone therapy      hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.     see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat male breast cancer.        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat men with breast cancer.     monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. monoclonal antibodies are also used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).      trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein her2.     see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information.
                
                
                    treatment for male breast cancer may cause side effects.

		            treatment options for male breast cancer
		            
		                
		                    initial surgery
		                    treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy. breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy may be used for some men.
		                
		                
		                    adjuvant therapy
		                    therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left.         -  node-negative: for men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women.     -  node-positive: for men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following:                - chemotherapy plus tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen).      - other hormone therapy.      - targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab).                 these treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women. the patients response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. most breast cancers in men have these receptors. hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse).
		                
		                
		                    distant metastases
		                    treatment for men with distant metastases (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) may be hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or both. hormone therapy may include the following:         -  orchiectomy (the removal of the testicles to decrease the amount of hormone made).    -  luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with or without total androgen blockade (to decrease the the amount of sex hormones made).    -  tamoxifen for cancer that is estrogen-receptor positive.    -  progestin (a female hormone made in a laboratory).    -  aromatase inhibitors (to decrease the amount of estrogen made).        hormone therapies may be used in sequence (one after the other). standard chemotherapy regimens may be used if hormone therapy does not work. men usually respond to therapy in the same way as women who have breast cancer."
what is (are) globozoospermia ?,"globozoospermia is a condition that affects only males. it is characterized by abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility).  normal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. the acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. the sperm cells of males with globozoospermia, however, have a round head and no acrosome. the abnormal sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to infertility."
what are the symptoms of brachydactyly type a1 ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of brachydactyly type a1? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for brachydactyly type a1. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) aplasia/hypoplasia of the thumb 90% brachydactyly syndrome 90% short hallux 90% short stature 90% cone-shaped epiphysis 50% abnormality of the metacarpal bones 7.5% abnormality of the ulna 7.5% clinodactyly of the 5th finger 7.5% scoliosis 7.5% symphalangism affecting the phalanges of the hand 7.5% talipes 7.5% absent distal interphalangeal creases - autosomal dominant inheritance - broad metacarpal epiphyses - broad palm - distal symphalangism (hands) - flattened metatarsal heads - heterogeneous - proportionate shortening of all digits - radial deviation of the 2nd finger - radial deviation of the 3rd finger - radial deviation of the 4th finger - short distal phalanx of finger - short metacarpal - short palm - short proximal phalanx of hallux - short proximal phalanx of thumb - slender metacarpals - thin proximal phalanges with broad epiphyses of the hand - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

is saddan inherited ?,"saddan is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one mutated copy of the fgfr3 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. the few described cases of saddan have been caused by new mutations in the fgfr3 gene and occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. no individuals with this disorder are known to have had children; therefore, the disorder has not been passed to the next generation."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for rett syndrome ?,"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) conduct research related to rett syndrome in laboratories at the nih, and also support additional rett syndrome research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. the discovery of the rett syndrome gene in 1999 provides a basis for further genetic studies. understanding the cause of this disorder is necessary for developing new therapies to manage specific symptoms, as well as for providing better methods of diagnosis."
what are the genetic changes related to miyoshi myopathy ?,"miyoshi myopathy is caused by mutations in the dysf or ano5 gene. when this condition is caused by ano5 gene mutations it is sometimes referred to as distal anoctaminopathy. the dysf and ano5 genes provide instructions for making proteins primarily found in muscles that are used for movement (skeletal muscles). the protein produced from the dysf gene, called dysferlin, is found in the thin membrane called the sarcolemma that surrounds muscle fibers. dysferlin is thought to aid in repairing the sarcolemma when it becomes damaged or torn due to muscle strain.  the ano5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. this protein is located within the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. anoctamin-5 is thought to act as a channel, allowing charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) to flow in and out of the endoplasmic reticulum. the regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.  dysf or ano5 gene mutations often result in a decrease or elimination of the corresponding protein. a lack of dysferlin leads to a reduced ability to repair damage done to the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. as a result, damage accumulates and leads to atrophy of the muscle fiber. it is unclear why this damage leads to the specific pattern of weakness and atrophy that is characteristic of miyoshi myopathy. the effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are also unclear. while chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of miyoshi myopathy."
what is (are) lichen planus pigmentosus ?,"lichen planus pigmentosus (lpp) is a rare form of lichen planus. it is characterized by oval or irregularly shaped brown to gray-brown macules and patches on the skin. areas that are exposed to sun such as the forehead, temples and neck are most commonly affected. however, the macules and patches may also develop on the trunk or in places where two areas of skin touch or rub together (i.e. the armpit, groin, etc). lpp is a chronic, relapsing condition with periods of exacerbations (worsening symptoms) separated by periods of remission (a decrease in or disappearance of symptoms). although the exact underlying cause of lpp is unknown, studies suggest that uv light, viral infections, and certain topical (applied to the skin) agents such as mustard oil and amla oil, may trigger the condition. treatment for lpp is symptomatic."

what is (are) mandibuloacral dysplasia ?,"mandibuloacral dysplasia is a condition that causes a variety of abnormalities involving bone development, skin coloring (pigmentation), and fat distribution. people with this condition may grow slowly after birth. most affected individuals are born with an underdeveloped lower jaw bone (mandible) and small collar bones (clavicles), leading to the characteristic features of a small chin and sloped shoulders. other bone problems include loss of bone from the tips of the fingers (acroosteolysis), which causes bulbous finger tips; delayed closure of certain skull bones; and joint deformities (contractures).  people with mandibuloacral dysplasia can have mottled or patchy skin pigmentation or other skin abnormalities. some people with this condition have features of premature aging (a condition called progeria), such as thin skin, loss of teeth, loss of hair, and a beaked nose. some individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia have metabolic problems, such as diabetes.  a common feature of mandibuloacral dysplasia is a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipodystrophy) in certain regions of the body. the two types of this disorder, mandibuloacral dysplasia with type a lipodystrophy (mada) and mandibuloacral dysplasia with type b lipodystrophy (madb) are distinguished by the pattern of fat distribution throughout the body. type a is described as partial lipodystrophy; affected individuals have a loss of fatty tissue from the torso and limbs, but it may build up around the neck and shoulders. type b is a generalized lipodystrophy, with loss of fatty tissue in the face, torso, and limbs.  mada usually begins in adulthood, although children can be affected. madb begins earlier, often just after birth. many babies with madb are born prematurely."
what are the genetic changes related to rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism ?,"rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism is caused by mutations in the atp1a3 gene. this gene provides instructions for making one part of a larger protein called na+/k+ atpase, also known as the sodium pump. this protein is critical for the normal function of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. it transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  mutations in the atp1a3 gene reduce the activity of the na+/k+ atpase or make the protein unstable. studies suggest that the defective protein is unable to transport ions normally, which disrupts the electrical activity of neurons in the brain. however, it is unclear how a malfunctioning na+/k+ atpase causes the movement abnormalities characteristic of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism.  in some people with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, no mutation in the atp1a3 gene has been identified. the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown in these individuals. researchers believe that mutations in at least one other gene, which has not been identified, can cause this disorder."
what is (are) cleft lip and palate ?,"cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby's lip or mouth do not form properly. they happen early during pregnancy. a baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.    a cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. this causes an opening in the upper lip. the opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. it can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.    children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. the roof of the mouth is called the ""palate."" with a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly. babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.    children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. they also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth.    often, surgery can close the lip and palate. cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. many children have other complications. they may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older. with treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.    centers for disease control and prevention"
who is at risk for respiratory distress syndrome? ?,"certain factors may increase the risk that your infant will have respiratory distress syndrome (rds). these factors include:
                
premature delivery. the earlier your baby is born, the greater his or her risk for rds. most cases of rds occur in babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy.
                
stress during your baby's delivery, especially if you lose a lot of blood.
                
infection.
                
your having diabetes.
                
your baby also is at greater risk for rds if you require an emergency cesarean delivery (c-section) before your baby is full term. you may need an emergency c-section because of a condition, such as a detached placenta, that puts you or your infant at risk.
                
planned c-sections that occur before a baby's lungs have fully matured also can increase the risk of rds. your doctor can do tests before delivery that show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. these tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity."
what to do for kidney stones in children ?,"families may benefit from meeting with a dietitian to learn how dietary management can help in preventing stones. depending on the underlying cause of the stone formation, medications may be necessary to prevent recurrent stones. dietary changes and medications may be required for a long term or, quite often, for life. some common changes include the following:
                
- children who tend to make calcium oxalate stones or have hypercalciuria should eat a regular amount of dietary calcium and limit salt intake. a thiazide diuretic medication may be given to some children to reduce the amount of calcium leaking into the urine.  - children who have large amounts of oxalate in the urine may need to limit foods high in oxalate, such as chocolate, peanut butter, and dark-colored soft drinks.  - children who form uric acid or cystine stones may need extra potassium citrate or potassium carbonate in the form of a pill or liquid medication. avoiding foods high in purinessuch as meat, fish, and shellfishmay also help prevent uric acid stones."
what are public health agencies doing to prevent or control botulism?,"public education about botulism prevention is an ongoing activity. information about safe canning is widely available for consumers. persons in state health departments and at cdc are knowledgeable about botulism and available to consult with physicians 24 hours a day. if antitoxin is needed to treat a patient, it can be quickly delivered to a physician anywhere in the country. suspected outbreaks of botulism are quickly investigated, and if they involve a commercial product, the appropriate control measures are coordinated among public health and regulatory agencies. physicians should immediately report suspected cases of botulism to their state health department.

what is (are) juvenile temporal arteritis ?,"juvenile temporal arteritis is a rare form of vasculitis, a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. unlike the classic form of temporal arteritis, this condition is generally diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood and only affects the temporal arteries (located at the lower sides of the skull, directly underneath the temple). affected people often have no signs or symptoms aside from a painless nodule or lump in the temporal region. the exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. it generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. juvenile temporal arteritis is often treated with surgical excision and rarely recurs."
what is (are) tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome ?,"tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome is a rare, inherited bone disorder that affects primarily the hands and feet. several individual bones make up each wrist (carpal bones) and ankle (tarsal bones). in tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, the carpal bones fuse together, as do the tarsal bones, which causes stiffness and immobility of the hands and feet. symptoms of the condition can become apparent in infancy, and they worsen with age. the severity of the symptoms can vary, even among members of the same family.  in this condition, fusion at the joints between the bones that make up each finger and toe (symphalangism) can also occur. consequently, the fingers and toes become stiff and difficult to bend. stiffness of the pinky fingers and toes (fifth digits) is usually noticeable first. the joints at the base of the pinky fingers and toes fuse first, and slowly, the other joints along the length of these digits may also be affected. progressively, the bones in the fourth, third, and second digits (the ring finger, middle finger, and forefinger, and the corresponding toes) become fused. the thumb and big toe are usually not involved. affected individuals have increasing trouble forming a fist, and walking often becomes painful and difficult. occasionally, there is also fusion of bones in the upper and lower arm at the elbow joint (humeroradial fusion). less common features of tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome include short stature or the development of hearing loss."
what is the outlook for leigh's disease ?,"the prognosis for individuals with leigh's disease is poor. individuals who lack mitochondrial complex iv activity and those with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency tend to have the worst prognosis and die within a few years. those with partial deficiencies have a better prognosis, and may live to be 6 or 7 years of age. some have survived to their mid-teenage years."
what is (are) parasites - lice - head lice ?,"the head louse, or pediculus humanus capitis, is a parasitic insect that can be found on the head, eyebrows, and eyelashes of people. head lice feed on human blood several times a day and live close to the human scalp. head lice are not known to spread disease."
who is at risk for heart disease in women? ?,"certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk forcoronary heart disease(chd). these conditions are known as risk factors. risk factors also increase the chance that existing chd will worsen.
                
women generally have the same chd risk factors as men. however, some risk factors may affect women differently than men. for example, diabetes raises the risk of chd more in women. also, some risk factors, such as birth control pills and menopause, only affect women.
                
there are many known chd risk factors. your risk for chd andheart attackrises with the number of risk factors you have and their severity. risk factors tend to ""gang up"" and worsen each other's effects.
                
having just one risk factor doubles your risk for chd. having two risk factors increases your risk for chd fourfold. having three or more risk factors increases your risk for chd more than tenfold.
                
also, some risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, put you at greater risk for chd and heart attack than others.
                
more than 75 percent of women aged 40 to 60 have one or more risk factors for chd. many risk factors start during childhood; some even develop within the first 10 years of life. you can control most risk factors, but some you can't.
                
for more information about chd risk factors, go to the health topics coronary heart disease risk factorsarticle. to find out whether you're at risk for chd, talk with your doctor or health care provider.
                
risk factors you can control
                
smoking
                
smoking is the most powerful risk factor that women can control. smoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk for chd and heart attack.
                
smoking exposes you to carbon monoxide. this chemical robs your blood of oxygen and triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries.
                
smoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack. the more you smoke, the greater your risk for a heart attack.
                
even women who smoke fewer than two cigarettes a day are at increased risk for chd.
                
high blood cholesterol and high triglyceride levels
                
cholesterol travels in the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (li-po-pro-teens). the two major kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol.
                
ldl cholesterol is sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol. this is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. hdl cholesterol is sometimes called ""good"" cholesterol. this is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.
                
a blood test called a lipoprotein panel is used to measure cholesterol levels. this test gives information about your total cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood).
                
cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dl) of blood. a woman's risk for chd increases if she has a total cholesterol level greater than 200 mg/dl, an ldl cholesterol level greater than 100 mg/dl, or an hdl cholesterol level less than 50 mg/dl.
                
a triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dl also increases a woman's risk for chd. a woman's hdl cholesterol and triglyceride levels predict her risk for chd better than her total cholesterol or ldl cholesterol levels.
                
high blood pressure
                
blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. if this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.
                
women who have blood pressure greater than 120/80 mmhg are at increased risk for chd. (the mmhg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)
                
high blood pressure is defined differently for people who have diabetes or chronic kidney disease. if you have one of these diseases, work with your doctor to set a healthy blood pressure goal.
                
diabetes and prediabetes
                
diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood sugar level is too high. this is because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.
                
insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it's used for energy. over time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries.
                
prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. prediabetes puts you at higher risk for both diabetes and chd.
                
diabetes and prediabetes raise the risk of chd more in women than in men. in fact, having diabetes doubles a woman's risk of developing chd.
                
before menopause, estrogen provides women some protection against chd. however, in women who have diabetes, the disease counters the protective effects of estrogen.
                
overweight and obesity
                
the terms ""overweight"" and ""obesity"" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.
                
the most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (bmi). bmi is calculated from your height and weight. in adults, a bmi of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal. a bmi of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. a bmi of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
you can use the national heart, lung, and blood institute's (nhlbi's) online bmi calculator to figure out your bmi, or your doctor can help you.
                
studies suggest that where extra weight occurs on the body may predict chd risk better than bmi. women who carry much of their fat around the waist are at greatest risk for chd. these women have ""apple-shaped"" figures.
                
women who carry most of their fat on their hips and thighsthat is, those who have ""pear-shaped"" figuresare at lower risk for chd.
                
to fully know how excess weight affects your chd risk, you should know your bmi and waist measurement. if you have a bmi greater than 24.9 and a waist measurement greater than 35 inches, you're at increased risk for chd.
                
if your waist measurement divided by your hip measurement is greater than 0.9, you're also at increased risk for chd.
                
studies also suggest that women whose weight goes up and down dramatically (typically due to unhealthy dieting) are at increased risk for chd. these swings in weight can lower hdl cholesterol levels.
                
metabolic syndrome
                
metabolic syndromeis the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for chd and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:
                
a large waistline. having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for chd than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.
                
a higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).
                
a lower than normal hdl cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low hdl cholesterol).
                
higher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).
                
higher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes)
                
metabolic syndrome is more common in african american women and mexican american women than in men of the same racial groups. the condition affects white women and men about equally.
                
birth control pills
                
women who smoke and take birth control pills are at very high risk for chd, especially if they're older than 35. for women who take birth control pills but don't smoke, the risk of chd isn't fully known.
                
lack of physical activity
                
inactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop chd as those who are physically active. a lack of physical activity can worsen other chd risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity.
                
unhealthy diet
                
an unhealthy diet can raise your risk for chd. for example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise your ldl cholesterol level. a high-sodium (salt) diet can raise your risk for high blood pressure.
                
foods with added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. this can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk for chd.
                
too much alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, and it will raise your blood pressure.
                
stress or depression
                
stress may play a role in causing chd. stress can trigger your arteries to narrow. this can raise your blood pressure and your risk for a heart attack.
                
getting upset or angry also can trigger a heart attack. stress also may indirectly raise your risk for chd if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.
                
people who are depressed are two to three times more likely to develop chd than people who are not. depression is twice as common in women as in men.
                
anemia
                
anemia (uh-nee-me-eh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.
                
the condition also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (hee-muh-glow-bin). hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your organs.
                
if you have anemia, your organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood. this causes your heart to work harder, which may raise your risk for chd.
                
anemia has many causes. for more information, go to the health topics anemiaarticle.
                
sleep apnea
                
sleep apneais a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. they often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour.
                
typically, normal breathing starts again after the pause, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. major signs of sleep apnea are snoring and daytime sleepiness.
                
when you stop breathing, the lack of oxygen triggers your body's stress hormones. this causes blood pressure to rise and makes the blood more likely to clot.
                
untreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.
                
women are more likely to develop sleep apnea after menopause.
                
risk factors you can't control
                
age and menopause
                
as you get older, your risk for chd and heart attack rises. this is due in part to the slow buildup of plaque inside your heart arteries, which can start during childhood.
                
before age 55, women have a lower risk for chd than men. estrogen provides women with some protection against chd before menopause. after age 55, however, the risk of chd increases in both women and men.
                
you may have gone through early menopause, either naturally or because you had your ovaries removed. if so, you're twice as likely to develop chd as women of the same age who aren't yet menopausal.
                
another reason why women are at increased risk for chd after age 55 is that middle age is when you tend to develop other chd risk factors.
                
women who have gone through menopause also are at increased risk for broken heart syndrome. (for more information, go to the section on emerging risk factors below.)
                
family history
                
family history plays a role in chd risk. your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with chd before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with chd before 65 years of age.
                
also, a family history of strokeespecially a mother's stroke historycan help predict the risk of heart attack in women.
                
having a family history of chd or stroke doesn't mean that you'll develop heart disease. this is especially true if your affected family member smoked or had other risk factors that were not well treated.
                
making lifestyle changes and taking medicines to treat risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent or delay heart problems.
                
preeclampsia
                
preeclampsia (pre-e-klamp-se-ah) is a condition that develops during pregnancy. the two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.
                
these signs usually occur during the second half of pregnancy and go away after delivery. however, your risk of developing high blood pressure later in life increases after having preeclampsia.
                
preeclampsia also is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including chd, heart attack, and heart failure. (likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases your risk for preeclampsia.)
                
if you had preeclampsia during pregnancy, you're twice as likely to develop heart disease as women who haven't had the condition. you're also more likely to develop heart disease earlier in life.
                
preeclampsia is a heart disease risk factor that you can't control. however, if you've had the condition, you should take extra care to try and control other heart disease risk factors.
                
the more severe your preeclampsia was, the greater your risk for heart disease. let your doctor know that you had preeclampsia so he or she can assess your heart disease risk and how to reduce it.
                
emerging risk factors
                
research suggests that inflammation plays a role in causing chd. inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.
                
high blood levels of a protein called c-reactive protein (crp) are a sign of inflammation in the body. research suggests that women who have high blood levels of crp are at increased risk for heart attack.
                
also, some inflammatory diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may increase the risk for chd.
                
some studies suggest that women who have migraine headaches may be at greater risk for chd. this is especially true for women who have migraines with auras (visual disturbances), such as flashes of light or zig-zag lines.
                
low bone density and low intake of folate and vitamin b6 also may raise a woman's risk for chd.
                
more research is needed to find out whether calcium supplements with or without vitamin d affect chd risk. you may want to talk with your doctor to find out whether these types of supplements are right for you.
                
researchers are just starting to learn about broken heart syndrome risk factors. most women who have this disorder are white and have gone through menopause.
                
many of these women have other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. however, these risk factors tend to be less common in women who have broken heart syndrome than in women who have chd."
what are the symptoms of x-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of x-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for x-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of neuronal migration 90% aplasia/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 90% cognitive impairment 90% cryptorchidism 90% hypoplasia of penis 90% microcephaly 90% seizures 90% hypohidrosis 50% malabsorption 50% muscular hypotonia 50% ventriculomegaly 50% aganglionic megacolon 7.5% exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 7.5% frontal bossing 7.5% hypertonia 7.5% patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% ventricular septal defect 7.5% agenesis of corpus callosum - decreased testicular size - diarrhea - duane anomaly - feeding difficulties in infancy - gliosis - high forehead - high palate - hyperreflexia - lissencephaly - long philtrum - long upper lip - low-set ears - micropenis - pachygyria - prominent nasal bridge - severe global developmental delay - spasticity - specific learning disability - wide anterior fontanel - wide nasal bridge - x-linked inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
is kallmann syndrome inherited ?,"kallmann syndrome 1 (caused by anos1 gene mutations) has an x-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. the anos1 gene is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  most cases of kallmann syndrome 1 are described as simplex, which means only one person in a family is affected. some affected people inherit a anos1 gene mutation from their mothers, who carry a single mutated copy of the gene in each cell. other people have the condition as a result of a new mutation in the anos1 gene.  other forms of kallmann syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  in several families, kallmann syndrome has shown an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) uv-sensitive syndrome ?,"uv-sensitive syndrome is a condition that is characterized by sensitivity to the ultraviolet (uv) rays in sunlight. even a small amount of sun exposure can cause a sunburn in affected individuals. in addition, these individuals can have freckles, dryness, or changes in coloring (pigmentation) on sun-exposed areas of skin after repeated exposure. some people with uv-sensitive syndrome have small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectasia), usually on the cheeks and nose. although uv exposure can cause skin cancers, people with uv-sensitive syndrome do not have an increased risk of developing these forms of cancer compared with the general population."
what is (are) 3-m syndrome ?,"3-m syndrome is a disorder that causes short stature (dwarfism), unusual facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. the name of this condition comes from the initials of three researchers who first identified it: miller, mckusick, and malvaux.  individuals with 3-m syndrome grow extremely slowly before birth, and this slow growth continues throughout childhood and adolescence. they have low birth weight and length and remain much smaller than others in their family, growing to an adult height of approximately 120 centimeters to 130 centimeters (4 feet to 4 feet 6 inches). affected individuals have a normally sized head that looks disproportionately large in comparison with their body. the head may be unusually long and narrow in shape (dolichocephalic).  in addition to short stature, people with 3-m syndrome have a triangle-shaped face with a broad, prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and a pointed chin; the middle of the face is less prominent (hypoplastic midface). they may have large ears, full eyebrows, an upturned nose with a fleshy tip, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), a prominent mouth, and full lips.  affected individuals may have a short, broad neck and chest with prominent shoulder blades and square shoulders. they may have abnormal spinal curvature such as a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis) or exaggerated curvature of the lower back (hyperlordosis). people with 3-m syndrome may also have unusual curving of the fingers (clinodactyly), short fifth (pinky) fingers, prominent heels, and loose joints. other skeletal abnormalities, such as unusually slender long bones in the arms and legs, tall, narrow spinal bones (vertebrae), or slightly delayed bone age may be apparent in x-ray images.  3-m syndrome can also affect other body systems. males with 3-m syndrome may produce reduced amounts of sex hormones (hypogonadism) and occasionally have the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). people with this condition may be at increased risk of developing bulges in blood vessel walls (aneurysms) in the brain. intelligence is unaffected by 3-m syndrome, and life expectancy is generally normal.  a variant of 3-m syndrome called yakut short stature syndrome has been identified in an isolated population in siberia. in addition to having most of the physical features characteristic of 3-m syndrome, people with this form of the disorder are often born with respiratory problems that can be life-threatening in infancy."
what are the treatments for diabetic retinopathy ?,"preventing disease progression during the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless you have macular edema. to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy, people with diabetes should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. treatment for macular edema research found that that prompt treatment of macular edema with anti-vegf drugs, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone or steroid injections. when injected into the eye, these drugs reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. in some cases, focal laser treatment is used along with the eye injections. your doctor places up to several hundred small laser burns in the areas of the retina around the macula that are leaking. these burns slow the leakage of fluid and reduce the amount of fluid in the retina. the surgery is usually completed in one session. further treatment may be needed. treatment for diabetic retinopathy proliferative retinopathy is treated with laser surgery. this procedure is called scatter laser treatment. scatter laser treatment helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. your doctor places 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink. because a high number of laser burns are necessary, two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment. although you may notice some loss of your side vision, scatter laser treatment can save the rest of your sight. scatter laser treatment may slightly reduce your color vision and night vision. scatter laser treatment works better before the fragile, new blood vessels have started to bleed. that is why it is important to have regular, comprehensive dilated eye exams. even if bleeding has started, scatter laser treatment may still be possible, depending on the amount of bleeding.  learn more about laser treatment.  vitrectomy if the bleeding is severe, you may need a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy. during a vitrectomy, blood is removed from the center of your eye. scatter laser treatment and vitrectomy are effective in treating proliferative retinopathy and in reducing vision loss. once you have proliferative retinopathy, you always will be at risk for new bleeding. you may need treatment more than once to protect your sight.  learn more about a vitrectomy.  have dilated eye exams the national eye institute (nei) urges everyone with diabetes to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. if you have diabetic retinopathy, you may need an exam more often. people with proliferative retinopathy can reduce their risk of blindness by 95 percent with timely treatment and appropriate follow-up care.  watch an animation to see what a comprehensive dilated eye exam includes.  research the national eye institute, or nei, is conducting and supporting research that seeks better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with diabetes. this research is conducted through studies in the laboratory and with patients. for example, researchers are studying drugs for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy that may reduce the need for laser surgery. a major study has shown that better control of blood sugar levels slows the onset and progression of retinopathy. the people with diabetes who kept their blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible also had much less kidney and nerve disease. better control also reduces the need for sight-saving laser surgery."
is lesch-nyhan syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
is x-linked infantile nystagmus inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two copies of the x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell can cause the condition, although affected females may experience less severe symptoms than affected males. approximately half of the females with only one altered copy of the frmd7 gene in each cell have no symptoms of this condition."
what causes prevent diabetes problems: keep your heart and blood vessels healthy ?,"narrowed blood vessels leave a smaller opening for blood to flow through. having narrowed blood vessels is like turning on a garden hose and holding your thumb over the opening. the smaller opening makes the water shoot out with more pressure. in the same way, narrowed blood vessels lead to high blood pressure. other factors, such as kidney problems and being overweight, also can lead to high blood pressure.
                
many people with diabetes also have high blood pressure. if you have heart, eye, or kidney problems from diabetes, high blood pressure can make them worse.
                
you will see your blood pressure written with two numbers separated by a slash. for example, your reading might be 120/70, said as ""120 over 70."" for most people with diabetes, the target is to keep the first number below 140 and the second number below 80, unless their doctor sets a different target.
                
if you have high blood pressure, ask your doctor how to lower it. your doctor may ask you to take blood pressure medicine every day. some types of blood pressure medicine can also help keep your kidneys healthy.
                
you may also be able to control your blood pressure by
                
- eating more fruits and vegetables  - eating less salt and high-sodium foods  - losing weight if you need to  - being physically active  - not smoking  - limiting alcoholic drinks"
what are the symptoms of lemierre syndrome ?,"what are the symptoms reported in children who have lemierre syndrome? in children and adolescents, lemierre syndrome usually begins with a severe sore throat, persistent fever, and possibly chills. some cases begin with acute otitis media. as the syndrome progresses, there is neck pain and tender swelling along the internal jugular vein.[ if undiagnosed, the next stage is the ""metastasis"" of septic emboli to the lungs, abdominal organs, brain or heart. lung involvement typically results in a productive cough (a cough that brings up mucus or phlegm) and chest pain. girls may report abdominal pain and have enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and jaundice, all of which indicate involvement of the liver."

what causes mitochondrial genetic disorders ?,"what causes mitochondrial genetic disorders? mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes (mutations) in either the mitochondrial dna or nuclear dna that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria. most dna (hereditary material that is passed from parent to child) is packaged within the nucleus of each cell (known as nuclear dna). however, mitochondria (the structures in each cell that produce energy) contain a small amount of their own dna, which is known as mitochondrial dna. when the mitochondria are not working properly, the body does not have enough energy to carry out its normal functions. this can lead to the variety of health problems associated with mitochondrial genetic disorders."
is gastrointestinal stromal tumor inherited ?,"most cases of gist are not inherited. sporadic gist is associated with somatic mutations, which are genetic changes that occur only in the tumor cells and occur during a person's lifetime.  in some cases of familial gist, including those associated with mutations in the kit and pdgfra genes, mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing tumors.  when familial gist is associated with mutations in other genes, it can have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means alterations in both copies of the gene in each cell increase a person's chance of developing tumors."
is pyruvate kinase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the symptoms of cadasil ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of cadasil? strokes are the main feature of cadasil and often occur repeatedly. strokes may lead to severe disability such as an inability to walk and urinary incontinence. the average age at onset for stroke-like episodes is 46 years. a decline in thinking ability (cognitive deficit) is the second most common feature and occurs in over half of affected people. this may begin as early as 35 years of age. cadasil typically causes a slow decline in thought processes, and approximately 75% of affected people eventually develop dementia (including significant difficulty with reasoning and memory). thirty percent of people with cadasil also experience psychiatric issues, varying from personality changes to severe depression. migraines with aura occur in about 35% of people with cadasil, with the first attack occurring at an average age of 26 years. epilepsy is present in 10% of affected people and usually presents at middle age. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for cadasil. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of temperature regulation 90% abnormality of the retinal vasculature 90% amaurosis fugax 90% behavioral abnormality 90% developmental regression 90% hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% migraine 90% neurological speech impairment 90% reduced consciousness/confusion 90% cerebral cortical atrophy 50% cerebral ischemia 50% cranial nerve paralysis 50% eeg abnormality 50% gait disturbance 50% hypertonia 50% memory impairment 50% visual impairment 50% abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function 7.5% atherosclerosis 7.5% hearing impairment 7.5% hypertension 7.5% hypoglycemia 7.5% intracranial hemorrhage 7.5% peripheral neuropathy 7.5% recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% seizures 7.5% subcutaneous hemorrhage 7.5% venous insufficiency 7.5% visual loss 5% abnormal electroretinogram - abnormality of the skin - abnormality of visual evoked potentials - adult onset - autosomal dominant inheritance - leukoencephalopathy - nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy - pseudobulbar paralysis - recurrent subcortical infarcts - stroke - subcortical dementia - urinary incontinence - varicose veins - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

is 5-alpha reductase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the srd5a2 gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  although people who are genetically female (with two x chromosomes in each cell) may inherit mutations in both copies of the srd5a2 gene, their sexual development is not affected. the development of female sex characteristics does not require dht, so a lack of steroid 5-alpha reductase 2 activity does not cause physical changes in these individuals. only people who have mutations in both copies of the srd5a2 gene and are genetically male (with one x and one y chromosome in each cell) have the characteristic signs of 5-alpha reductase deficiency."
what are the symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of mecp2 duplication syndrome? mecp2 duplication syndrome is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in males and is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability. infants affected by this condition are generally diagnosed with severe hypotonia within the first few weeks of life. this reduced muscle tone can lead to feeding difficulties which may require a feeding tube. trouble swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, failure to thrive, and extensive drooling are also common symptoms. distinctive physical features may be noticed shortly after birth which can include brachycephaly (abnormally flat back of the head), midface hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the middle of the face), large ears, deep-set eyes, prominent chin, and a depressed nasal bridge. due to hypotonia, affected children often have delayed development of motor milestones such as sitting up and crawling. approximately, one third of affected people never walk independently and those who are able to walk may have an abnormal gait (style of walking). in most cases, hypotonia gives way to spasticity during childhood. progressive spasticity, which is generally more pronounced in the legs, may lead to the development of mild contractures. consequently, many affected adults require the use of a wheelchair. the majority of affected people do not develop the ability to talk. some may have limited speech during early childhood, but frequently this ability is progressively lost during adolescence. other signs and symptoms associated with mecp2 duplication syndrome may include seizures; autistic features; clinically significant constipation and bladder dysfunction. many people affected by mecp2 duplication syndrome have recurrent respiratory tract infections. these respiratory infections can be life-threatening and as a result, approximately half of affected people succumb by age 25. in most cases, females with a duplication of the mecp2 gene do not have any symptoms, although depression, anxiety, and autistic features have been described in some. when affected, women with mecp2 duplication syndrome are generally less severely affected than males with the condition. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mecp2 duplication syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - abnormality of the teeth - absent speech - anxiety - ataxia - brachycephaly - bruxism - chorea - constipation - cryptorchidism - depressed nasal bridge - depression - drooling - dysphagia - facial hypotonia - flat midface - gastroesophageal reflux - infantile muscular hypotonia - intellectual disability - low-set ears - macrocephaly - macrotia - malar flattening - microcephaly - narrow mouth - poor eye contact - progressive - progressive spasticity - recurrent respiratory infections - rigidity - seizures - severe global developmental delay - tented upper lip vermilion - x-linked recessive inheritance - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what to do for iga nephropathy ?,"- immunoglobulin a (iga) nephropathy, also known as bergers disease, is a kidney disease that occurs when iga deposits build up in the kidneys, causing inflammation that damages kidney tissues.  - scientists think that iga nephropathy is an autoimmune kidney disease, meaning that the disease is due to the bodys immune system attacking tissues in the kidney.  - iga nephropathy is one of the most common kidney diseases, other than those caused by diabetes or high blood pressure.  - in its early stages, iga nephropathy may have no symptoms; it can be silent for years or even decades.  - once symptoms appear, the most common one is hematuria, or blood in the urine.  - another symptom of iga nephropathy is albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an increased amount of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood, or large amounts of protein in the urine.  - currently, health care providers do not use blood or urine tests as reliable ways to diagnose iga nephropathy; therefore, the diagnosis of iga nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy.  - researchers have not yet found a specific cure for iga nephropathy."
who is at risk for depression? ?,"the risk factors for depression are family history, life experiences, and environment. if you have depression, you may have experienced it when you were younger, and may have a family history of the illness. you may also be going through difficult life events, such as physical or psychological trauma, losing a loved one, a difficult relationship with a family member or friend, or financial troubles. any of these stressful experiences can lead to depression. for older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors may be at play. depression may be related to changes that occur in the brain and body as a person ages. for example, some older adults who are at risk for illnesses such as heart disease or stroke may have hardening and inflammation of the blood vessels, and blood may not be able to flow normally to the body's organs, including the brain. over time, this blood vessel disease and restricted blood flow can damage nearby brain tissue and harm the nerve connections that help different parts of the brain communicate with each other. if this happens, an older adult with no family history of depression may develop what some doctors call ""vascular depression."" older adults may also experience depression as a result of brain changes caused by illnesses such as alzheimers disease or parkinsons disease. this type of depression can appear in the early stages of these diseases, before many symptoms appear."
how many people are affected by sotos syndrome ?,"sotos syndrome is reported to occur in 1 in 10,000 to 14,000 newborns. because many of the features of sotos syndrome can be attributed to other conditions, many cases of this disorder are likely not properly diagnosed, so the true incidence may be closer to 1 in 5,000."

what is (are) merkel cell carcinoma ?,"key points
                    - merkel cell carcinoma is a very rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the skin.    - sun exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of merkel cell carcinoma.    - merkel cell carcinoma usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin.    - tests and procedures that examine the skin are used to detect (find) and diagnose merkel cell carcinoma.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    merkel cell carcinoma is a very rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the skin.
                    merkel cells are found in the top layer of the skin. these cells are very close to the nerve endings that receive the sensation of touch. merkel cell carcinoma, also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin or trabecular cancer, is a very rare type of skin cancer that forms when merkel cells grow out of control. merkel cell carcinoma starts most often in areas of skin exposed to the sun, especially the head and neck, as well as the arms, legs, and trunk.     merkel cell carcinoma tends to grow quickly and to metastasize (spread) at an early stage. it usually spreads first to nearby lymph nodes and then may spread to lymph nodes or skin in distant parts of the body, lungs, brain, bones, or other organs."
what is (are) familial mediterranean fever ?,"familial mediterranean fever (fmf) is an inherited condition characterized by episodes of painful inflammation of the abdominal lining (peritonitis),  lining surrounding the lungs (pleurisy), and joints (arthralgia and occasionally arthritis). these episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a characteristic ankle rash. the first episode usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. between attacks, people often do not have any symptoms. without treatment, fmf can lead to kidney failure due to a buildup of certain protein deposits (amyloidosis). fmf is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in the mefv gene. treatment for fmf often involves use of a medication called colchicine."
what are the genetic changes related to enlarged parietal foramina ?,"mutations in the alx4 gene account for 60 percent of cases of enlarged parietal foramina and mutations in the msx2 gene account for 40 percent of cases. these genes provide instructions for producing proteins called transcription factors, which are required for proper development throughout the body. transcription factors attach (bind) to specific regions of dna and help control the activity of particular genes. the alx4 and msx2 transcription factor proteins are involved in regulating genes that are needed in various cell processes in early development.  mutations in either the alx4 or msx2 gene likely impair the ability of their respective transcription factors to bind to dna. as a result, the regulation of multiple genes is altered, which disrupts a number of necessary cell functions. the processes that guide skull development seem to be particularly sensitive to changes in the activity of these transcription factors.  if the condition is caused by a mutation in the msx2 gene, it is called enlarged parietal foramina type 1. mutations in the alx4 gene cause enlarged parietal foramina type 2. there appears to be no difference in the size of the openings between enlarged parietal foramina types 1 and 2."
what are the genetic changes related to nager syndrome ?,"the cause of nager syndrome is unknown. although the specific genes involved have not been identified, researchers believe that this condition is caused by changes in a particular region of chromosome 9 in some families.  nager syndrome disrupts the development of structures called the first and second pharyngeal arches. the pharyngeal arches are five paired structures that form on each side of the head and neck during embryonic development. these structures develop into the bones, skin, nerves, and muscles of the head and neck. in particular, the first and second pharyngeal arches develop into the jaw, the nerves and muscles for chewing and facial expressions, the bones in the middle ear, and the outer ear. the cause of the abnormal development of the pharyngeal arches in nager syndrome is unknown. it is also unclear why affected individuals have bone abnormalities in their arms and legs."
what are the symptoms of kuskokwim disease ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of kuskokwim disease? the range and and severity of signs and symptoms in individuals with kuskokwim disease can vary, even among siblings. affected individuals usually have congenital contractures, especially of lower extremities, which progress during childhood and persist for the lifetime of the individual. however, not all individuals with the condition have contractures at birth. the severity of contractures can be very asymmetrical in any given individual. the knees and elbows are often affected, and skeletal abnormalities of the spine, pelvis, and feet also commonly occur. muscle atrophy of limbs with contractures and displacement of kneecaps (patellae) have also been reported. milder skeletal features are common. vertebral features may include spondylolisthesis, mild to moderate scoliosis, and/or lordosis. many affected individuals have had several low-energy fractures. other skeletal abnormalities that have been reported include bunions (hallux valgus), ""flat feet"" (plano valgus feet), and clubfoot (talipes equinovarus). development and arrangement of the teeth (dentition) are normal. although some individuals with full bilateral contractures of the knees can move about by duck walking (sitting with buttocks on their heels) or by knee walking (moving on their knees with their lower legs drawn up behind them to their buttocks), most affected individuals are treated with leg braces and/or surgery in childhood and can walk upright. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for kuskokwim disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) gait disturbance 90% limitation of joint mobility 90% patellar aplasia 90% talipes 50% abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% abnormality of the clavicle 7.5% aplasia/hypoplasia of the radius 7.5% melanocytic nevus 7.5% scoliosis 7.5% autosomal recessive inheritance - skeletal muscle atrophy - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
how many people are affected by epidermolysis bullosa simplex ?,"the exact prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa simplex is unknown, but this condition is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 people. the localized type is the most common form of the condition."

what is (are) infectious arthritis ?,"most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. the infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - intense pain in the joint    - joint redness and swelling    - chills and fever    - inability to move the area with the infected joint       one type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. the reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. the joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. in women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. for both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    to diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery."
what is (are) olivopontocerebellar atrophy ?,"olivopontocerebellar atrophy (opca) is a term that describes the degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain  the cerebellum, pons, and inferior olives. opca is present in several neurodegenerative syndromes, including inherited and non-inherited forms of ataxia (such as the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia known as machado-joseph disease) and multiple system atrophy (msa), with which it is primarily associated. http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/msa/msa.htm
                
opca may also be found in the brains of individuals with prion disorders and inherited metabolic diseases. the characteristic areas of brain damage that indicate opca can be seen by imaging the brain using ct scans or mri studies."
what is (are) gorlin syndrome ?,"gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors.  in people with gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of skin cancer. individuals with gorlin syndrome typically begin to develop basal cell carcinomas during adolescence or early adulthood. these cancers occur most often on the face, chest, and back. the number of basal cell carcinomas that develop during a person's lifetime varies among affected individuals. some people with gorlin syndrome never develop any basal cell carcinomas, while others may develop thousands of these cancers. individuals with lighter skin are more likely to develop basal cell carcinomas than are people with darker skin.  most people with gorlin syndrome also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors. these tumors usually first appear during adolescence, and new tumors form until about age 30. keratocystic odontogenic tumors rarely develop later in adulthood. if untreated, these tumors may cause painful facial swelling and tooth displacement.  individuals with gorlin syndrome have a higher risk than the general population of developing other tumors. a small proportion of affected individuals develop a brain tumor called medulloblastoma during childhood. a type of benign tumor called a fibroma can occur in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. heart (cardiac) fibromas often do not cause any symptoms, but they may obstruct blood flow or cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia). ovarian fibromas are not thought to affect a woman's ability to have children (fertility).  other features of gorlin syndrome include small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull. these signs and symptoms are typically apparent from birth or become evident in early childhood."
what is (are) spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 ?,"spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (sca6) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. people with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). other early signs and symptoms of sca6 include speech difficulties, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and double vision. over time, individuals with sca6 may develop loss of coordination in their arms, tremors, and uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia).  signs and symptoms of sca6 typically begin in a person's forties or fifties but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood. most people with this disorder require wheelchair assistance by the time they are in their sixties."
how to diagnose cystic fibrosis ?,"doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (cf) based on the results from various tests.
                
newborn screening
                
all states screen newborns for cf using a genetic test or a blood test. the genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty cftr genes. the blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly.
                
sweat test
                
if a genetic test or blood test suggests cf, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. this test is the most useful test for diagnosing cf. a sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat.
                
for this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. he or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. this may cause a tingling or warm feeling.
                
sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. the sweat test usually is done twice. high salt levels confirm a diagnosis of cf.
                
other tests
                
if you or your child has cf, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as:
                
genetic tests to find out what type of cftr defect is causing your cf.
                
a chest x ray. this test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. a chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air.
                
a sinus x ray. this test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of cf.
                
lung function tests. these tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.
                
a sputum culture. for this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. if you have bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas, you may have more advanced cf that needs aggressive treatment.
                
prenatal screening
                
if you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has cf. these tests include amniocentesis (am-ne-o-sen-te-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-on-ik vil-us) sampling (cvs).
                
in amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. he or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. the fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's cftr genes are normal.
                
in cvs, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. the doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. the sample is tested to see whether the baby has cf.
                
cystic fibrosis carrier testing
                
people who have one normal cftr gene and one faulty cftr gene are cf carriers. cf carriers usually have no symptoms of cf and live normal lives. however, carriers can pass faulty cftr genes on to their children.
                
if you have a family history of cf or a partner who has cf (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a cf carrier.
                
a genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty cf gene. this type of testing can detect faulty cf genes in 9 out of 10 cases."

what causes bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria ?,"what causes bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria? the exact underlying cause of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (bpp) is unknown. the signs and symptoms associated with the condition are thought to be due to improper development of the outer surface of the brain (cerebral cortex) during embryonic growth. the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for conscious movement and thought, normally consists of several deep folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci). however, in people affected by bpp, the cerebral cortex has an abnormally increased number of gyri that are unusually small. scientists believe that these abnormalities occur when newly developed brain cells fail to migrate to their destined locations in the outer portion of the brain. specific non-genetic causes of polymicrogyria have been recognized, including exposure to cytomegalovirus infection (cmv) during pregnancy. polymicrogyria has also been associated with certain complications in twin pregnancies."
what are the treatments for kidney failure: choosing a treatment that's right for you ?,"you have three treatment options to choose from to filter your blood. a fourth option offers care without replacing the work of the kidneys. none of these treatments helps the kidneys get better. however, they all can help you feel better.
                
- hemodialysis uses a machine to move your blood through a filter outside your body, removing wastes.  - peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood inside your body, removing wastes.  - kidney transplantation is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a person who has just died or a living person, usually a family member, into your body to take over the job of filtering your blood.  - conservative management is the choice not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. instead, the focus is on using medicines to keep you comfortable, preserving kidney function through diet, and treating the problems of kidney failure, such as anemiaa shortage of red blood cells that can make you tiredand weak bones."
what is (are) trichothiodystrophy ?,"trichothiodystrophy, which is commonly called ttd, is a rare inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. the hallmark of this condition is brittle hair that is sparse and easily broken. tests show that the hair is lacking sulfur, an element that normally gives hair its strength.  the signs and symptoms of trichothiodystrophy vary widely. mild cases may involve only the hair. more severe cases also cause delayed development, significant intellectual disability, and recurrent infections; severely affected individuals may survive only into infancy or early childhood.  mothers of children with trichothiodystrophy may experience problems during pregnancy including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia) and a related condition called hellp syndrome that can damage the liver. babies with trichothiodystrophy are at increased risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and slow growth.  most affected children have short stature compared to others their age. intellectual disability and delayed development are common, although most affected individuals are highly social with an outgoing and engaging personality. some have brain abnormalities that can be seen with imaging tests. trichothiodystrophy is also associated with recurrent infections, particularly respiratory infections, which can be life-threatening. other features of trichothiodystrophy can include dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis); abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails; clouding of the lens in both eyes from birth (congenital cataracts); poor coordination; and skeletal abnormalities.  about half of all people with trichothiodystrophy have a photosensitive form of the disorder, which causes them to be extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (uv) rays from sunlight. they develop a severe sunburn after spending just a few minutes in the sun. however, for reasons that are unclear, they do not develop other sun-related problems such as excessive freckling of the skin or an increased risk of skin cancer. many people with trichothiodystrophy report that they do not sweat."
what is (are) plasmablastic lymphoma ?,"plasmablastic lymphoma is an aggressive form of non-hodgkin lymphoma. although the condition most commonly occurs in the oral cavity, it can be diagnosed in many other parts of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and skin. the exact underlying cause of plasmablastic lymphoma is poorly understood; however, it is often associated with suppression of the immune system (i.e. hiv infection, immunosuppressive therapy). there is currently no standard therapy for plasmablastic lymphoma. treatment usually consists of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
what is (are) pars planitis ?,"pars planitis is a disease of the eye that is characterized by inflammation of the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. this may lead to blurred vision; dark, floating spots in the vision; and progressive vision loss. as the condition advances, cataracts, retinal detachment, or macular edema (fluid within the retina) may develop. pars planitis most often affects young men and is generally not associated with any other disease or symptoms (idiopathic); however, it can be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis. treatment typically includes corticosteroid drugs, immunosuppressive medications, and/or surgery."

what is (are) progressive supranuclear palsy ?,"progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a rare brain disorder that causes serious and progressive problems with control of gait and balance, along with complex eye movement and thinking problems. one of the classic signs of the disease is an inability to aim the eyes properly, which occurs because of lesions in the area of the brain that coordinates eye movements. some individuals describe this effect as a blurring. affected individualsoften show alterations of mood and behavior, including depression and apathy as well as progressive mild dementia.
                
the disorder's long name indicates that the disease begins slowly and continues to get worse (progressive), and causes weakness (palsy) by damaging certain parts of the brain above pea-sized structures called nuclei that control eye movements (supranuclear).
                
psp was first described as a distinct disorder in 1964, when three scientists published a paper that distinguished the condition from parkinson's disease. it is sometimes referred to as steele-richardson-olszewski syndrome, reflecting the combined names of the scientists who defined the disorder. although psp gets progressively worse, no one dies from psp itself."
what are the genetic changes related to charcot-marie-tooth disease ?,"charcot-marie-tooth disease is caused by mutations in many different genes. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the function of peripheral nerves in the feet, legs, and hands. the gene mutations that cause charcot-marie-tooth disease affect the function of the proteins in ways that are not fully understood; however, they likely impair axons, which transmit nerve impulses, or affect the specialized cells that produce myelin. as a result, peripheral nerve cells slowly lose the ability to stimulate the muscles and to transmit sensory signals to the brain.  the list of genes associated with charcot-marie-tooth disease continues to grow as researchers study this disorder. different mutations within a particular gene may cause signs and symptoms of differing severities or lead to different types of charcot-marie-tooth disease.  cmt1 is caused by mutations in the following genes: pmp22 (cmt1a and cmt1e), mpz (cmt1b), litaf (cmt1c), egr2 (cmt1d), and nefl (cmt1f).  cmt2 can result from alterations in many genes, including mfn2 and kif1b (cmt2a); rab7a (cmt2b); lmna (cmt2b1); trpv4 (cmt2c); bscl2 and gars (cmt2d); nefl (cmt2e); hspb1 (cmt2f); mpz (cmt2i and cmt2j); gdap1 (cmt2k); and hspb8 (cmt2l). certain dnm2 gene mutations also cause a form of cmt2.  cmt4 is caused by mutations in the following genes: gdap1 (cmt4a), mtmr2 (cmt4b1), sbf2 (cmt4b2), sh3tc2 (cmt4c), ndrg1 (cmt4d), egr2 (cmt4e), prx (cmt4f), fgd4 (cmt4h), and fig4 (cmt4j).  intermediate forms of the disorder can be caused by alterations in genes including dnm2, mpz, yars, and gdap1. cmtx is caused by mutations in genes including gjb1 (cmtx1) and prps1 (cmtx5). mutations in additional genes, some of which have not been identified, also cause various forms of charcot-marie-tooth disease."
how to prevent diabetes ?,"your weight affects your health in many ways. being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin properly. it can also cause high blood pressure. if you are overweight or obese, choose sensible ways to reach and maintain a reasonable body weight. - make healthy food choices. what you eat has a big impact on your weight and overall health. by developing healthy eating habits you can help control your body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. reducing portion size, increasing the amount of fiber you consume (by eating more fruits and vegetables) and limiting fatty and salty foods are key to a healthy diet. make healthy food choices. what you eat has a big impact on your weight and overall health. by developing healthy eating habits you can help control your body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. reducing portion size, increasing the amount of fiber you consume (by eating more fruits and vegetables) and limiting fatty and salty foods are key to a healthy diet. -  get at least 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week. regular exercise reduces diabetes risk in several ways: it helps you lose weight, controls your cholesterol and blood pressure, and improves your body's use of insulin. many people make walking part of their daily routine because it's easy, fun and convenient. but you can choose any activity that gets you moving. it's fine to break up your 30 minutes of exercise into smaller increments, such as three 10-minute periods. check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program.   get at least 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week. regular exercise reduces diabetes risk in several ways: it helps you lose weight, controls your cholesterol and blood pressure, and improves your body's use of insulin. many people make walking part of their daily routine because it's easy, fun and convenient. but you can choose any activity that gets you moving. it's fine to break up your 30 minutes of exercise into smaller increments, such as three 10-minute periods. check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program."
is hereditary sensory neuropathy type ie inherited ?,"how is hereditary sensory neuropathy type ie inherited? hereditary sensory neuropathy type ie (hsnie) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. when a person with a mutation that causes hsnie has children, each child has a 50% (1/2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. a person who does not inherit the mutation from an affected parent is not at risk to pass the condition on to his/her children."
what is (are) pervasive developmental disorders ?,"the diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorders (pdd) refers to a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills. parents may note symptoms as early as infancy, although the typical age of onset is before 3 years of age. symptoms may include problems with using and understanding language; difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; unusual play with toys and other objects; difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings, and repetitive body movements or behavior patterns. autism (a developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication skills, and a limited range of activities and interests) is the most characteristic and best studied pdd. other types of pdd include asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and rett's syndrome. children with pdd vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident. unusual responses to sensory information, such as loud noises and lights, are also common."
is heterotaxy syndrome inherited ?,"most often, heterotaxy syndrome is sporadic, meaning that only one person in a family is affected. however, about 10 percent of people with heterotaxy syndrome have a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) who has a congenital heart defect without other apparent features of heterotaxy syndrome. isolated congenital heart defects and heterotaxy syndrome may represent a range of signs and symptoms that can result from a particular genetic mutation; this situation is known as variable expressivity. it is also possible that different genetic and environmental factors combine to produce isolated congenital heart defects in some family members and heterotaxy syndrome in others.  when heterotaxy syndrome runs in families, it can have an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked pattern of inheritance, depending on which gene is involved. autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. in x-linked inheritance, the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell.  when heterotaxy syndrome occurs as a feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia, it has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
what is (are) multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?,"men1 is an inherited disorder that causes tumors in the endocrine glands and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. men1 is sometimes called multiple endocrine adenomatosis or wermer's syndrome, after one of the first doctors to recognize it. men1 is rare, occurring in about one in 30,000 people.1 the disorder affects both sexes equally and shows no geographical, racial, or ethnic preferences.
                
endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. hormones are powerful chemicals that travel through the blood, controlling and instructing the functions of various organs. normally, the hormones released by endocrine glands are carefully balanced to meet the body's needs.
                
in people with men1, multiple endocrine glands form tumors and become hormonally overactive, often at the same time. the overactive glands may include the parathyroids, pancreas, or pituitary. most people who develop overactivity of only one endocrine gland do not have men1."
what to do for mntriers disease ?,"researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing mntriers disease. in some cases, a health care provider may prescribe a high-protein diet to offset the loss of protein due to mntriers disease. some people with severe malnutrition may require iv nutrition, which is called total parenteral nutrition (tpn). tpn is a method of providing an iv liquid food mixture through a special tube in the chest."

what is (are) hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type v ?,"hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type v (hsan5) is a condition that affects the sensory nerve cells. these cells, which are also called sensory neurons, transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop at birth or during early infancy and may include a loss of pain and temperature sensation. because of the inability to feel deep pain, affected people suffer repeated severe injuries such as bone fractures and joint injuries that go unnoticed. hsan5 is caused by changes (mutations) in the ngf gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. medical management is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and is oriented to control hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) and prevent injury."
how to diagnose parasites - enterobiasis (also known as pinworm infection) ?,"a person infected with pinworm is often asymptomatic, but itching around the anus is a common symptom. diagnosis of pinworm can be reached from three simple techniques. the first option is to look for the worms in the perianal reqion 2 to 3 hours after the infected person is asleep. the second option is to touch the perianal skin with transparent tape to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus first thing in the morning. if a person is infected, the eggs on the tape will be visible under a microscope. the tape method should be conducted on 3 consecutive mornings right after the infected person wakes up and before he/she does any washing. since anal itching is a common symptom of pinworm, the third option for diagnosis is analyzing samples from under fingernails under a microscope. an infected person who has scratched the anal area may have picked up some pinworm eggs under the nails that could be used for diagnosis.
    
since pinworm eggs and worms are often sparse in stool, examining stool samples is not recommended. serologic tests are not available for diagnosing pinworm infections."
what is (are) prostate cancer ?,"the body is made up of many types of cells. normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy. sometimes, however, the process goes wrong -- cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. these extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous."

what are the symptoms of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome? symptoms and severity of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome varies greatly from person to person.  in general, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is characterized by skin spots (nevi) that may be few to hundreds in number. size tends varies from millimeters to several centimeters in length. these nevi are made of blood vessels and are spongy, meaning they can easily be pressed upon.  when pressure is released, they refill with blood and regain their original shape.  they tend to be blue but can vary in color and shape. the surface of the nevi may be smooth or wrinkled and they often have a rubbery feel. they do not tend to bleed spontaneously, but are fragile and will bleed if injured. they may be tender to the touch. they may also be associated with increased sweating in the area of the skin legions. the number and size of legions may worsen with advancing age.  nevi may also be found in the intestines (particularly the small intestine) in individuals with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. these nevi can bleed spontaneously causing anemia. most bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is slow; however, sudden quick bleeding (hemorrhage) is possible. other serious complications of gastrointestinal legions may include intussusception, bowel infarction, and even death. blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome can affect other body organs as well.  nevi have been reported in the skull, central nervous system, thyroid, parotid, eyes, mouth, lungs, pleura, pericardium, musculoskeletal system, peritoneal cavity, mesentery, kidney, liver, spleen, penis, vulva, and bladder.  nevi may also put pressure on joints, bones, or feet, which may make walking difficult or limit range of motion. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of coagulation 90% arteriovenous malformation 90% bone pain 90% cavernous hemangioma 90% skin rash 90% visceral angiomatosis 90% gastrointestinal hemorrhage 50% intestinal malrotation 50% gastrointestinal infarctions 7.5% microcytic anemia 7.5% abnormality of the liver - abnormality of the mouth - abnormality of the respiratory system - autosomal dominant inheritance - cerebellar medulloblastoma - chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation - hemangioma - hypermelanotic macule - intestinal bleeding - intussusception - iron deficiency anemia - pathologic fracture - rectal prolapse - thrombocytopenia - volvulus - the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

                    - after adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.     - there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - the following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma:         - stage i     - stage ii     - stage iii     - stage iv
                
                
                    after adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging. staging of soft tissue sarcoma is also based on the grade and size of the tumor, whether it is superficial (close to the skin's surface) or deep, and whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               -  the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body, such as the lung and abdomen, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).     -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.         the results of these tests are viewed together with the results of the tumor biopsy to find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given. sometimes chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again.
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells. the disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    the following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma:
                    stage i     stage i is divided into stages ia and ib:            - in stage ia, the tumor is low-grade (likely to grow and spread slowly) and 5 centimeters or smaller. it may be either superficial (in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below) or deep (in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue).     - in stage ib, the tumor is low-grade (likely to grow and spread slowly) and larger than 5 centimeters. it may be either superficial (in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below) or deep (in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue).              stage ii     stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib:            - in stage iia, the tumor is mid-grade (somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly) or high-grade (likely to grow and spread quickly) and 5 centimeters or smaller. it may be either superficial (in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below) or deep (in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue).     - in stage iib, the tumor is mid-grade (somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly) and larger than 5 centimeters. it may be either superficial (in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below) or deep (in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue).              stage iii    in stage iii, the tumor is either:            -  high-grade (likely to grow and spread quickly), larger than 5 centimeters, and either superficial (in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below) or deep (in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue); or     - any grade, any size, and has spread to nearby lymph nodes.           stage iii cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is advanced stage iii.       stage iv    in stage iv, the tumor is any grade, any size, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs."
what are the treatments for ataxia telangiectasia ?,"there is no cure for a-t and, currently, no way to slow the progression of the disease. treatment is symptomatic and supportive. physical and occupational therapy help to maintain flexibility. speech therapy is important, teaching children to control air flow to the vocal cords. gamma-globulin injections may be useful if immunoglobulin levels are sufficiently reduced to weaken the immune system. high-dose vitamin regimens and antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid also may also be used."
what is (are) ataxia with oculomotor apraxia ?,"ataxia with oculomotor apraxia is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. the hallmark of this condition is difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which is often the first symptom. most affected people also have oculomotor apraxia, which makes it difficult to move their eyes side-to-side. people with oculomotor apraxia have to turn their head to see things in their side (peripheral) vision.  there are multiple types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. the types are very similar but are caused by mutations in different genes. the two most common types (types 1 and 2) share features, in addition to ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, that include involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). in type 1, ataxia beings around age 4; in type 2, ataxia begins around age 15. chorea and myoclonus tend to disappear gradually in type 1; these movement problems persist throughout life in type 2. individuals with type 1 often develop wasting (atrophy) in their hands and feet, which further impairs movement. nearly all individuals with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia develop neuropathy, which leads to absent reflexes and weakness. neuropathy causes many individuals with this condition to require wheelchair assistance, typically 10 to 15 years after the start of movement problems. intelligence is usually not affected by this condition, but some people have intellectual disability.  people with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 tend to have decreased amounts of a protein called albumin, which transports molecules in the blood. this decrease in albumin likely causes an increase in the amount of cholesterol circulating in the bloodstream. increased cholesterol levels may raise a person's risk of developing heart disease. people with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 have increased blood cholesterol, but they have normal albumin levels. individuals with type 2 tend to have high amounts of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in their blood. (an increase in the level of this protein is normally seen in the bloodstream of pregnant women.) affected individuals may also have high amounts of a protein called creatine phosphokinase (cpk) in their blood. this protein is found mainly in muscle tissue. the effect of abnormally high levels of afp or cpk in people with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 is unknown."
is multiple sclerosis inherited ?,"the inheritance pattern of multiple sclerosis is unknown, although the condition does appear to be passed down through generations in families. the risk of developing multiple sclerosis is higher for siblings or children of a person with the condition than for the general population."

what are the complications of urine blockage in newborns ?,"when a defect in the urinary tract blocks the flow of urine, the urine backs up and causes the ureters to swell, called hydroureter, and hydronephrosis.
                
hydronephrosis is the most common problem found during prenatal ultrasound of a baby in the womb. the swelling may be easy to see or barely detectable. the results of hydronephrosis may be mild or severe, yet the long-term outcome for the childs health cannot always be predicted by the severity of swelling. urine blockage may damage the developing kidneys and reduce their ability to filter. in the most severe cases of urine blockage, where little or no urine leaves the babys bladder, the amount of amniotic fluid is reduced to the point that the babys lung development is threatened.
                
after birth, urine blockage may raise a childs risk of developing a uti. recurring utis can lead to more permanent kidney damage."
what are the genetic changes related to pmm2-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?,"pmm2-cdg is caused by mutations in the pmm2 gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (pmm2). the pmm2 enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. mutations in the pmm2 gene lead to the production of an abnormal pmm2 enzyme with reduced activity. without a properly functioning pmm2 enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally. as a result, incorrect oligosaccharides are produced and attached to proteins. the wide variety of signs and symptoms in pmm2-cdg are likely due to the production of abnormally glycosylated proteins in many organs and tissues."

                    - chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.    - signs and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.
                
                
                    chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.
                    eosinophils are white blood cells that react to allergens (substances that cause an allergic response) and help fight infections caused by certain parasites. in chronic eosinophilic leukemia, there are too many eosinophils in the blood, bone marrow, and other tissues. chronic eosinophilic leukemia may stay the same for many years or it may progress quickly to acute leukemia."
what are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest ?,"usually, the first sign of sudden cardiac arrest (sca) is loss of consciousness (fainting). at the same time, no heartbeat (or pulse) can be felt.
                
some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. within an hour before sca, some people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), or vomiting."
what is (are) diabetic neuropathies: the nerve damage of diabetes ?,"diabetic neuropathy can be classified as peripheral, autonomic, proximal, or focal. each affects different parts of the body in various ways.
                
- peripheral neuropathy, the most common type of diabetic neuropathy, causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms.  - autonomic neuropathy causes changes in digestion, bowel and bladder function, sexual response, and perspiration. it can also affect the nerves that serve the heart and control blood pressure, as well as nerves in the lungs and eyes. autonomic neuropathy can also cause hypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which people no longer experience the warning symptoms of low blood glucose levels.  - proximal neuropathy causes pain in the thighs, hips, or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs.  - focal neuropathy results in the sudden weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves, causing muscle weakness or pain. any nerve in the body can be affected.

what are the genetic changes related to juvenile primary osteoporosis ?,"mutations in the lrp5 gene can cause juvenile primary osteoporosis. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that participates in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. in particular, the lrp5 protein is involved in the regulation of bone mineral density.  lrp5 gene mutations that cause juvenile primary osteoporosis result in an lrp5 protein that cannot transmit signals along the pathway. the resulting reduction in signaling impairs proper bone development, causing decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis at a young age.  many people with childhood-onset osteoporosis do not have a mutation in the lrp5 gene. (when its cause is unknown, the condition is often called idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis). it is likely that mutations in other genes that have not been identified are involved in this condition."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer ?,"cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    new ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

what causes childhood ependymoma ?,the cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown.
what is (are) aicardi-goutieres syndrome ?,"aicardi-goutieres syndrome is a disorder that mainly affects the brain, the immune system, and the skin.  most newborns with aicardi-goutieres syndrome do not show any signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. however, about 20 percent are born with a combination of features that include an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), elevated blood levels of liver enzymes, a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), and abnormal neurological responses. while this combination of signs and symptoms is typically associated with the immune system's response to congenital viral infection, no actual infection is found in these infants. for this reason, aicardi-goutieres syndrome is sometimes referred to as a ""mimic of congenital infection.""  within the first year of life most individuals with aicardi-goutieres syndrome experience an episode of severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), typically lasting for several months. during this phase of the disorder, affected babies are usually extremely irritable and do not feed well. they may develop intermittent fevers in the absence of infection (sterile pyrexias) and may have seizures. they stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they had already acquired (developmental regression). growth of the brain and skull slows down, resulting in an abnormally small head size (microcephaly). in this phase of the disorder, white blood cells and molecules associated with inflammation can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). these abnormal findings are consistent with inflammation and tissue damage in the central nervous system.  the encephalopathic phase of aicardi-goutieres syndrome leaves behind permanent neurological damage that is usually severe. medical imaging reveals deterioration of white matter in the brain (leukodystrophy). white matter consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin, which is a substance that insulates and protects nerves. affected individuals also have abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain.  most people with aicardi-goutieres syndrome have profound intellectual disability. they also have significant neuromuscular problems including muscle stiffness (spasticity); involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), especially those in the arms; and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in the trunk.  about 40 percent of people with aicardi-goutieres syndrome have painful, itchy skin lesions, usually on the fingers, toes, and ears. these puffy, red lesions, which are called chilblains, are caused by inflammation of small blood vessels. they may be brought on or made worse by exposure to cold. vision problems, joint stiffness, and mouth ulcers may also occur in this disorder.  as a result of the severe neurological problems usually associated with aicardi-goutieres syndrome, most people with this disorder do not survive past childhood. however, some affected individuals who have later onset and milder neurological problems may live into adulthood."

what is (are) testicular cancer ?,"testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. they are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. you can get cancer in one or both testicles.    testicular cancer mainly affects young men between the ages of 20 and 39. it is also more common in men who       - have had abnormal testicle development    - have had an undescended testicle    - have a family history of the cancer       symptoms include pain, swelling, or lumps in your testicles or groin area. doctors use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose testicular cancer. most cases can be treated, especially if found early. treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. regular exams after treatment are important.    treatments may also cause infertility. if you may want children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment.    nih: national cancer institute"
how to prevent sudden cardiac arrest ?,"ways to prevent death due to sudden cardiac arrest (sca) differ depending on whether:
                
you've already had sca
                
you've never had sca but are at high risk for the condition
                
you've never had sca and have no known risk factors for the condition
                
for people who have survived sudden cardiac arrest
                
if you've already had sca, you're at high risk of having it again. research shows that an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) reduces the chances of dying from a second sca.an icd is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. the device has wires with electrodes on the ends that connect to your heart's chambers. the icd monitors your heartbeat.
                
if the icd detects a dangerous heart rhythm, it gives an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm. your doctor may give you medicine to limit irregular heartbeats that can trigger the icd.
                
implantable cardioverter defibrillator
                

                
an icd isn't the same as a pacemaker. the devices are similar, but they have some differences. pacemakers give off low-energy electrical pulses. they're often used to treat less dangerous heart rhythms, such as those that occur in the upper chambers of the heart. most new icds work as both pacemakers and icds.
                
for people at high risk for a first sudden cardiac arrest
                
if you have severe coronary heart disease (chd), you're at increased risk for sca. this is especially true if you've recently had a heart attack.
                
your doctor may prescribe a type of medicine called a beta blocker to help lower your risk for sca. your doctor also may discuss beginning statin treatment if you have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
diabetes
                
heart disease or had a prior stroke
                
high ldl cholesterol levels
                
your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
lower blood pressure.
                
prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.
                
reduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.
                
take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. you should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.
                
other treatments for coronary heart diseasesuch as percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graftingalso may lower your risk for sca. your doctor also may recommend an icd if youre at high risk for sca.
                
for people who have no known risk factors for sudden cardiac arrest
                
chd seems to be the cause of most scas in adults. chd also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems.
                
following a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk for chd, sca, and other heart problems. a heart-healthy lifestyle includes:
                
heart-healthy eating
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
managing stress
                
physical activity
                
quitting smoking
                
heart-healthy eating
                
heart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
when following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
a lot of red meat
                
palm and coconut oils
                
sugary foods and beverages
                
two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. when you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. to help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
if you eat:
                
try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day              
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day    
                
1,500 calories a day           
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day           
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day           
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day           
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
not all fats are bad. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
avocados
                
corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
peanut butter
                
salmon and trout
                
tofu
                
sodium
                
you should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. this means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. if you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
dietary approaches to stop hypertension
                
your doctor may recommend the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. the dash eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
the dash eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. read more about dash.
                
limiting alcohol
                
try to limit alcohol intake. too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. one drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for sudden cardiac arrest. aim for a healthy weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
knowing your body mass index (bmi) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. to figure out your bmi, check out the national heart, lung, and blood institutes online bmi calculator or talk to your doctor. a bmi:
                
below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range
                
between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight
                
of 30.0 or higher is considered obese
                
a general goal to aim for is a bmi of less than 25. your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate bmi goal.
                
measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. if most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. this risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. to learn how to measure your waist, visit assessing your weight and health risk.
                
if youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. a loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower ldl cholesterol, and increase hdl cholesterol.
                
managing stress
                
managing and coping with stress. learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
a stress management program
                
meditation
                
physical activity
                
relaxation therapy
                
talking things out with friends or family
                
physical activity
                
regular physical activity can lower your risk for coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and other health problems. everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. the more active you are, the more you will benefit. participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

quitting smoking
                
people who smoke are more likely to have a heart attack than are people who dont smoke. the risk of having a heart attack increases with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. smoking also raises your risk for stroke and lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and lung cancer.
                
quitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk for heart and lung diseases. ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. read more about how to quit smoking."
what are the treatments for bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) ?,"key points
                    - there are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer.    - three types of standard treatment are used:         - surgery     - radiation therapy     - chemotherapy        - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - liver transplant        - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer.
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with bile duct cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery    the following types of surgery are used to treat bile duct cancer:            - removal of the bile duct: a surgical procedure to remove part of the bile duct if the tumor is small and in the bile duct only. lymph nodes are removed and tissue from the lymph nodes is viewed under a microscope to see if there is cancer.      -  partial hepatectomy: a surgical procedure in which the part of the liver where cancer is found is removed. the part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some normal tissue around it.      -  whipple procedure: a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin.           even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. it is not yet known whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery helps keep the cancer from coming back.    the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms caused by a blocked bile duct and improve quality of life:            -  biliary bypass: a surgical procedure in which the part of the bile duct before the blockage is connected with part of the bile duct that is past the blockage or to the small intestine. this allows bile to flow to the gallbladder or small intestine.     -  stent placement: a surgical procedure in which a stent (a thin, flexible tube or metal tube) is placed in the bile duct to open it and allow bile to flow into the small intestine or through a catheter that goes to a collection bag outside of the body.      -  percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: a procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. a thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. if the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body.              radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -   internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat bile duct cancer.    it is not yet known whether external radiation therapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer. in unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, new ways to improve the effect of external radiation therapy on cancer cells are being studied:            -  hyperthermia therapy: a treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy and certain anticancer drugs.     -  radiosensitizers: drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more cancer cells.              chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     systemic chemotherapy is used to treat unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer. it is not yet known whether systemic chemotherapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer.     in unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, intra-arterial embolization is being studied. it is a procedure in which the blood supply to a tumor is blocked after anticancer drugs are given in blood vessels near the tumor. sometimes, the anticancer drugs are attached to small beads that are injected into an artery that feeds the tumor. the beads block blood flow to the tumor as they release the drug. this allows a higher amount of drug to reach the tumor for a longer period of time, which may kill more cancer cells.
                 
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     liver transplant    in a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. a liver transplant may be done in patients with perihilar bile duct cancer. if the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with childhood liver cancer.
                    different types of treatments are available for children with liver cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with liver cancer. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    children with liver cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of healthcare providers who are experts in treating this rare childhood cancer.
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with liver cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. it is especially important to have a pediatric surgeon with experience in liver surgery who can send patients to a liver transplant program if needed. other specialists may include the following:         -  pediatrician.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  pediatric nurse specialist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.    -  psychologist.    -  social worker.
                
                
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment may include:          - physical problems.     - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.     -  second cancers (new types of cancer).        some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information).
                
                
                    six types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery    when possible, the cancer is removed by surgery.            - partial hepatectomy: removal of the part of the liver where cancer is found. the part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with a small amount of normal tissue around it.      - total hepatectomy and liver transplant: removal of the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor. a liver transplant may be possible when cancer has not spread beyond the liver and a donated liver can be found. if the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.      -  resection of metastases: surgery to remove cancer that has spread outside of the liver, such as to nearby tissues, the lungs, or the brain.            factors that affect the type of surgery used include the following:            - the pretext group and posttext group.     - the size of the primary tumor.     - whether there is more than one tumor in the liver.     - whether the cancer has spread to nearby large blood vessels.     - the level of alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in the blood.     - whether the tumor can be shrunk by chemotherapy so that it can be removed by surgery.     - whether a liver transplant is needed.           chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery, to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove. this is called neoadjuvant therapy.    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       watchful waiting     watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. in hepatoblastoma, this treatment is only used for small tumors that have been completely removed by surgery.       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). treatment using more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy.      chemoembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat childhood liver cancer. the anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). the drug is mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. the blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. the tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. the liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine. this procedure is also called transarterial chemoembolization or tace.    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the pretext or posttext group.        radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the pretext or posttext group. radioembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of internal radiation therapy used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. a very small amount of a radioactive substance is attached to tiny beads that are injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). the beads are mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. most of the radiation is trapped near the tumor to kill the cancer cells. this is done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for children with hepatocellular carcinoma. external radiation therapy is used to treat hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.       ablation therapy     ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue. different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer:             -  radiofrequency ablation: the use of special needles that are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. high-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells. radiofrequency ablation is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.     -  percutaneous ethanol injection: a small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells. several treatments may be needed. percutaneous ethanol injection is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.              antiviral treatment    hepatocellular carcinoma that is linked to the hepatitis b virus may be treated with antiviral drugs.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver and liver cancer that has come back.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the treatment group may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what is (are) nephronophthisis ?,"nephronophthisis is a disorder that affects the kidneys. it is characterized by inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) that impairs kidney function. these abnormalities lead to increased urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), general weakness, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). in addition, affected individuals develop fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, usually in an area known as the corticomedullary region. another feature of nephronophthisis is a shortage of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia.  nephronophthisis eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (esrd), a life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. nephronophthisis can be classified by the approximate age at which esrd begins: around age 1 (infantile), around age 13 (juvenile), and around age 19 (adolescent).  about 85 percent of all cases of nephronophthisis are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. some people with nephronophthisis have additional features, which can include liver fibrosis, heart abnormalities, or mirror image reversal of the position of one or more organs inside the body (situs inversus).  nephronophthisis can occur as part of separate syndromes that affect other areas of the body; these are often referred to as nephronophthisis-associated ciliopathies. for example, senior-lken syndrome is characterized by the combination of nephronophthisis and a breakdown of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal degeneration); joubert syndrome affects many parts of the body, causing neurological problems and other features, which can include nephronophthisis."
what are the genetic changes related to darier disease ?,"mutations in the atp2a2 gene cause darier disease. the atp2a2 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme abbreviated as serca2. this enzyme acts as a pump that helps control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. the endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport. the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a structure in muscle cells that assists with muscle contraction and relaxation by releasing and storing calcium ions. calcium ions act as signals for a large number of activities that are important for the normal development and function of cells. serca2 allows calcium ions to pass into and out of the cell in response to cell signals.  mutations in the atp2a2 gene result in insufficient amounts of functional serca2 enzyme. a lack of serca2 enzyme reduces calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing it to become dysfunctional. serca2 is expressed throughout the body; it is not clear why changes in this enzyme affect only the skin. some researchers note that skin cells are the only cell types expressing serca2 that do not have a ""back-up"" enzyme for calcium transport. this dependence on the serca2 enzyme may make skin cells particularly vulnerable to changes in this enzyme.  the linear form of darier disease is caused by atp2a2 gene mutations that are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. these changes are called somatic mutations and are not inherited. there have been no known cases of people with the linear form of darier disease passing it on to their children."
is mcleod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome inherited ?,"mcleod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. rarely, females with a mutation in one copy of the xk gene can have the characteristic misshapen blood cells and movement problems associated with mcleod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

what is (are) gerstmann's syndrome ?,"gerstmann's syndrome is a cognitive impairment that results from damage to a specific area of the brain -- the left parietal lobe in the region of the angular gyrus. it may occur after a stroke or in association with damage to the parietal lobe. it is characterized by four primary symptoms: a writing disability (agraphia or dysgraphia), a lack of understanding of the rules for calculation or arithmetic (acalculia or dyscalculia), an inability to distinguish right from left, and an inability to identify fingers (finger agnosia). the disorder should not be confused with gerstmann-strussler-scheinker disease, a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
                
in addition to exhibiting the above symptoms, many adults also experience aphasia, (difficulty in expressing oneself when speaking, in understanding speech, or in reading and writing).
                
there are few reports of the syndrome, sometimes called developmental gerstmann's syndrome, in children. the cause is not known. most cases are identified when children reach school age, a time when they are challenged with writing and math exercises. generally, children with the disorder exhibit poor handwriting and spelling skills, and difficulty with math functions, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. an inability to differentiate right from left and to discriminate among individual fingers may also be apparent. in addition to the four primary symptoms, many children also suffer from constructional apraxia, an inability to copy simple drawings. frequently, there is also an impairment in reading. children with a high level of intellectual functioning as well as those with brain damage may be affected with the disorder."
what is (are) progressive familial heart block ?,"progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. a normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. these signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). from there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of his. this bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. in people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.  progressive familial heart block can be divided into type i and type ii, with type i being further divided into types ia and ib. these types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. in types ia and ib, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type ii, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. the different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.  most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. the most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging. other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue."
what are the treatments for pachygyria ?,"how might pachygyria be treated? because the symptoms of the condition vary from person to person, treatment is symptomatic, and may include anti-seizure medication, such as trileptal, and special or supplemental education consisting of physical, occupational, and speech therapies."

is nonsyndromic hearing loss inherited ?,"as discussed above, nonsyndromic hearing loss has different patterns of inheritance. between 75 and 80 percent of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. usually, each parent of an individual with autosomal recessive hearing loss carries one copy of the mutated gene but does not have hearing loss.  another 20 to 25 percent of nonsyndromic hearing loss has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. most people with autosomal dominant hearing loss inherit an altered copy of the gene from a parent who also has hearing loss.  between 1 and 2 percent of cases have an x-linked pattern of inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. males with x-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss tend to develop more severe hearing loss earlier in life than females who inherit a copy of the same gene mutation. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  mitochondrial forms of the condition, which result from changes to mtdna, account for less than 1 percent of all nonsyndromic hearing loss in the united states. these cases are inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. this pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtdna. because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtdna mutations from their mother. these disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtdna to their children.  in some cases, hearing loss occurs in people with no history of the condition in their family. these cases are described as sporadic, and the cause of the hearing loss is often unknown. when hearing loss results from environmental factors, it is not inherited."

what are the genetic changes related to asperger syndrome ?,"while genetic factors are believed to contribute to the development of asperger syndrome, no related genes have been confirmed. it is unclear whether certain gene variations that are being studied in other autism spectrum disorders will play a role in asperger syndrome. it appears likely that a combination of genetic variations and environmental factors influence the development of this complex condition.  asperger syndrome is a disorder of brain development. researchers have identified differences in the structure and function of specific regions of the brain between children with asperger syndrome and unaffected children. these differences likely arise during development before birth, when cells in the brain are migrating to their proper places.  the differences in brain development that occur in asperger syndrome appear to affect areas of the brain involved in thought, behavior, and emotions, such as the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the fusiform face area. in particular, cognitive functions called theory of mind, central coherence, and executive function are affected.  theory of mind is the ability to understand that other people have their own ideas, emotions, and perceptions, and to empathize with them. it is related to the proper functioning of a brain mechanism called the mirror neuron system, which is normally active both when certain actions are performed and when others are observed performing the same actions. researchers believe that the mirror neuron system is impaired in people with asperger syndrome.  central coherence is the ability to integrate individual perceptions into a larger context, commonly known as ""seeing the big picture."" for example, a person with asperger syndrome may be able to describe individual trees in great detail without recognizing that they are part of a forest.  executive function is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. this function includes skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, focusing attention appropriately, and cognitive flexibility. people with deficits in these skills may have difficulty in some activities of daily living and in social interactions.  the differences in cognitive functioning observed in people with asperger syndrome are believed to give rise to the behavioral patterns characteristic of this condition."

what is (are) familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,"familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a hereditary disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. this condition affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. the disorder prevents blood vessels from forming at the edges of the retina, which reduces the blood supply to this tissue.  the signs and symptoms of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy vary widely, even within the same family. in many affected individuals, the retinal abnormalities never cause any vision problems. in others, a reduction in the retina's blood supply causes the retina to fold, tear, or separate from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). this retinal damage can lead to vision loss and blindness. other eye abnormalities are also possible, including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil.  some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy also have reduced bone mineral density, which weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures."
how to prevent urinary tract infection in adults ?,"changing some daily habits may help a person prevent recurrent utis.
                
eating, diet, and nutrition
                
drinking lots of fluid can help flush bacteria from the system. water is best. most people should try for six to eight, 8-ounce glasses a day. talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.
                
urination habits
                
a person should urinate often and when the urge arises. bacteria can grow when urine stays in the bladder too long. women and men should urinate shortly after sex to flush away bacteria that might have entered the urethra during sex. drinking a glass of water will also help flush bacteria away.
                
after using the toilet, women should wipe from front to back. this step is most important after a bowel movement to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra.
                
clothing
                
cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes should be worn, so air can keep the area around the urethra dry. tight-fitting jeans and nylon underwear should be avoided because they can trap moisture and help bacteria grow.
                
birth control
                
for women, using a diaphragm or spermicide for birth control can lead to utis by increasing bacteria growth. a woman who has trouble with utis should try switching to a new form of birth control. unlubricated condoms or spermicidal condoms increase irritation, which may help bacteria grow. switching to lubricated condoms without spermicide or using a nonspermicidal lubricant may help prevent utis."
what is (are) abdominal aortic aneurysm ?,"abdominal aortic aneurysms (aaas) are aneurysms that occur in the part of the aorta that passes through the abdomen. they may occur at any age, but are most common in men between 50 and 80 years of age. many people with an aaa have no symptoms, but some people have a pulsing sensation in the abdomen and/or pain in the back. if the aneurysm ruptures, it may cause deep, severe pain; nausea; vomiting; fast heart rate; clammy skin; and/or shock. about 20% of aaas eventually rupture and are often fatal. the condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome. when more than one family member is affected, it may be considered ""familial abdominal aortic aneurysm."" treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm."
what are the genetic changes related to central core disease ?,"mutations in the ryr1 gene cause central core disease.  the ryr1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ryanodine receptor 1. this protein plays an essential role in skeletal muscles. for the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. the ryanodine receptor 1 protein forms a channel that releases calcium ions stored within muscle cells. the resulting increase in calcium ion concentration inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract, allowing the body to move.  mutations in the ryr1 gene change the structure of ryanodine receptor 1, allowing calcium ions to ""leak"" through the abnormal channel or impairing the channel's ability to release stored calcium ions at the correct time. this disruption in calcium ion transport prevents muscles from contracting normally, leading to the muscle weakness characteristic of central core disease."
is triple a syndrome inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

                    small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
                    the lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs that are found in the chest. the lungs bring oxygen into the body when you breathe in and take out carbon dioxide when you breathe out. each lung has sections called lobes. the left lung has two lobes. the right lung, which is slightly larger, has three. a thin membrane called the pleura surrounds the lungs. two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. the bronchi are sometimes also affected by lung cancer. small tubes called bronchioles and tiny air sacs called alveoli make up the inside of the lungs.     there are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.    this summary is about small cell lung cancer and its treatment. see the following pdq summaries for more information about lung cancer:          -  non-small cell lung cancer treatment     -  unusual cancers of childhood treatment     -  lung cancer prevention     -  lung cancer screening
                
                
                    there are two main types of small cell lung cancer.
                    these two types include many different types of cells. the cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. the types of small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look when viewed under a microscope:         - small cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer).     - combined small cell carcinoma.
                
                
                    for most patients with small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
                    if lung cancer is found, patients should think about taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment. clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of small cell lung cancer. information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website."
what are the genetic changes related to andermann syndrome ?,"mutations in the slc12a6 gene cause andermann syndrome. the slc12a6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a k-cl cotransporter. this protein is involved in moving charged atoms (ions) of potassium (k) and chlorine (cl) across the cell membrane. the positively charged potassium ions and negatively charged chlorine ions are moved together (cotransported), so that the charges inside and outside the cell membrane are unchanged (electroneutral).  electroneutral cotransport of ions across cell membranes is involved in many functions of the body. while the specific function of the k-cl cotransporter produced from the slc12a6 gene is unknown, it seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of nerve tissue. it may be involved in regulating the amounts of potassium, chlorine, or water in cells and intercellular spaces. the k-cl cotransporter protein may also help regulate the activity of other proteins that are sensitive to ion concentrations.  mutations in the slc12a6 gene that cause andermann syndrome disrupt the function of the k-cl cotransporter protein. the lack of functional protein normally produced from the slc12a6 gene is believed to interfere with the development of the corpus callosum and maintenance of the nerves that transmit signals needed for movement and sensation, resulting in the signs and symptoms of andermann syndrome."
what is (are) kidney failure: eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ?,"potassium is a mineral found in many foods, especially milk, fruits, and vegetables. it affects how steadily your heart beats. healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in the blood to keep the heart beating at a steady pace. potassium levels can rise between dialysis sessions and affect your heartbeat. eating too much potassium can be very dangerous to your heart. it may even cause death.
                
to control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like avocados, bananas, kiwis, and dried fruit, which are very high in potassium. also, eat smaller portions of other high-potassium foods. for example, eat half a pear instead of a whole pear. eat only very small portions of oranges and melons.
                
dicing and boiling potatoes to reduce potassium   you can remove some of the potassium from potatoes by dicing or shredding them and then boiling them in water. your dietitian will give you more specific information about the potassium content of foods.

- ultrasound exam. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers offi ce, outpatient center, or hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. if gallstones are present, they will be visible in the image. ultrasound is the most accurate method to detect gallstones.  - computerized tomography (ct) scan. a ct scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. a ct scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-d) images. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. an x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. ct scans can show gallstones or complications, such as infection and blockage of the gallbladder or bile ducts. however, ct scans can miss gallstones that are present.  - magnetic resonance imaging (mri). mri machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confi ned spaces may receive light sedation. an mri may include the injection of contrast medium. with most mri machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines allow the person to lie in a more open space. mris can show gallstones in the ducts of the biliary system.  - cholescintigraphy. cholescintigraphyalso called a hydroxyl iminodiacetic acid scan, hida scan, or hepatobiliary scanuses an unharmful radioactive material to produce pictures of the biliary system. in cholescintigraphy, the person lies on an exam table and a health care provider injects a small amount of unharmful radioactive material into a vein in the persons arm. the health care provider may also inject a substance that causes the gallbladder to contract. a special camera takes pictures of the radioactive material as it moves through the biliary system. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. cholescintigraphy is used to diagnose abnormal contractions of the gallbladder or obstruction of the bile ducts.   - endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). ercp uses an x ray to look into the bile and pancreatic ducts. after lightly sedating the person, the health care provider inserts an endoscopea small,  flexible tube with a light and a camera on the endthrough the mouth into the duodenum and bile ducts. the endoscope is connected to a computer and video monitor. the health care provider injects contrast medium through the tube into the bile ducts, which makes the ducts show up on the monitor. the health care provider performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital. ercp helps the health care provider locate the affected bile duct and the gallstone. the stone is captured in a tiny basket attached to the endoscope and removed. this test is more invasive than other tests and is used selectively.
                
health care providers also use blood tests to look for signs of infection or in flammation of the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, or liver. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers offi ce or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.
                
gallstone symptoms may be similar to those of other conditions, such as appendicitis, ulcers, pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease.
                
sometimes, silent gallstones are found when a person does not have any symptoms. for example, a health care provider may notice gallstones when performing ultrasound for a different reason."

heart failure is more common in:
                
people who are age 65 or older. aging can weaken the heart muscle. older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. heart failure is a leading cause of hospital stays among people on medicare.
                
blacks are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. theyre also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age, have more hospital visits due to heart failure, and die from heart failure.
                
people who areoverweight. excess weight puts strain on the heart. being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2diabetes. these diseases can lead to heart failure.
                
people who have had a heart attack. damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack and can weaken the heart muscle.
                
children who havecongenital heart defectsalso can develop heart failure. these defects occur if the heart, heart valves, or blood vessels near the heart dont form correctly while a baby is in the womb. congenital heart defects can make the heart work harder. this weakens the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure. children dont have the same symptoms of heart failure or get the same treatments as adults. this health topic focuses on heart failure in adults."

is spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. an affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. however, some people with sca2 do not have a parent with the disorder. individuals who have an increase in the number of cag repeats in the atxn2 gene, but do not develop sca2, are at risk of having children who will develop the disorder.  as the altered atxn2 gene is passed down from one generation to the next, the length of the cag trinucleotide repeat often increases. a larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. this phenomenon is called anticipation. anticipation tends to be more prominent when the atxn2 gene is inherited from a person's father (paternal inheritance) than when it is inherited from a person's mother (maternal inheritance)."

                    - there are different types of treatment for patients with aids-related lymphoma.     - treatment of aids-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for aids.    - four types of standard treatment are used:         - chemotherapy      - radiation therapy     - high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     - targeted therapy        - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.     - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with aids-related lymphoma.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with aids-related lymphoma. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    treatment of aids-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for aids.
                    patients with aids have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. for this reason, treating patients who have aids-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have aids.    combined antiretroviral therapy (cart) is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by hiv. treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with aids-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. in these patients, treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have aids. medicine to prevent and treat infections, which can be serious, is also used.   for more information about aids and its treatment, please see the aidsinfo website.
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used:
                    chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system (cns).       chemotherapy is used in the treatment of aids-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma. it is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.     colony-stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy. this helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow.       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            the way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. external radiation therapy is used to treat aids-related primary cns lymphoma.       high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy.    monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. these may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. rituximab is used in the treatment of aids-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what is (are) dehydration ?,"when you're dehydrated, your body doesn't have enough fluid to work properly. an average person on an average day needs about 3 quarts of water. but if you're out in the hot sun, you'll need a lot more than that. most healthy bodies are very good at regulating water. elderly people, young children and some special cases - like people taking certain medications - need to be a little more careful.    signs of dehydration in adults include       - being thirsty    - urinating less often than usual    - dark-colored urine    - dry skin    - feeling tired    - dizziness and fainting       signs of dehydration in babies and young children include a dry mouth and tongue, crying without tears, no wet diapers for 3 hours or more, a high fever and being unusually sleepy or drowsy.    if you think you're dehydrated, drink small amounts of water over a period of time. taking too much all at once can overload your stomach and make you throw up. for people exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat, sports drinks can be helpful. avoid any drinks that have caffeine."
what is (are) narcolepsy ?,"narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that disrupts the normal sleep-wake cycle. although this condition can appear at any age, it most often begins in adolescence.  narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. affected individuals feel tired during the day, and several times a day they may experience an overwhelming urge to sleep. ""sleep attacks"" can occur at unusual times, such as during a meal or in the middle of a conversation. they last from a few seconds to a few minutes and often lead to a longer nap, after which affected individuals wake up feeling refreshed.  another common feature of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (such as laughing, surprise, or anger). these episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump over or fall, which occasionally leads to injury. episodes of cataplexy usually last just a few seconds, and they may occur from several times a day to a few times a year. most people diagnosed with narcolepsy also have cataplexy. however, some do not, which has led researchers to distinguish two major forms of the condition: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy.  narcolepsy also affects nighttime sleep. most affected individuals have trouble sleeping for more than a few hours at night. they often experience vivid hallucinations while falling asleep (hypnogogic hallucinations) or while waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations). affected individuals often have realistic and distressing dreams, and they may act out their dreams by moving excessively or talking in their sleep. many people with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for a short period while falling asleep or awakening. the combination of hallucinations, vivid dreams, and sleep paralysis is often frightening and unpleasant for affected individuals.  some people with narcolepsy have all of the major features of the disorder, while others have only one or two. most of the signs and symptoms persist throughout life, although episodes of cataplexy may become less frequent with age and treatment."
what are the genetic changes related to giant congenital melanocytic nevus ?,"nras gene mutations cause most cases of giant congenital melanocytic nevus. rarely, mutations in the braf gene are responsible for this condition.  the proteins produced from these genes are involved in a process known as signal transduction by which signals are relayed from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. signals relayed by the n-ras and braf proteins instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). to transmit signals, these proteins must be turned on; when the proteins are turned off, they do not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.  the nras or braf gene mutations responsible for giant congenital melanocytic nevus are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. these mutations occur early in embryonic development during the growth and division (proliferation) of cells that develop into melanocytes. somatic nras or braf gene mutations cause the altered protein in affected cells to be constantly turned on (constitutively active) and relaying signals. the overactive protein may contribute to the development of giant congenital melanocytic nevus by allowing cells that develop into melanocytes to grow and divide uncontrollably, starting before birth."

what is (are) transient neonatal diabetes mellitus ?,"transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (tndb) is a type of diabetes that appears within the first few weeks of life but is transient; affected infants go into remission within a few months, with possible relapse to permanent diabetes in adolescence or adulthood. affected individuals have slow growth before birth followed by hyperglycemia, dehydration and failure to thrive in infancy. approximately 70% of cases are caused by the overactivity of certain genes in a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 called 6q24. these cases are referred to as 6q24-related tndb; most (but not all) of these cases are not inherited. other genetic causes include mutations in the kcnj11 and abcc8 genes, which usually cause permanent neonatal diabetes. treatment may include rehydration and intravenous insulin at the time of diagnosis, followed by subcutaneous insulin."
how to diagnose cirrhosis ?,"a health care provider usually diagnoses cirrhosis based on the presence of conditions that increase its likelihood, such as heavy alcohol use or obesity, and symptoms. a health care provider may test for cirrhosis based on the presence of these conditions alone because many people do not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. a health care provider may confirm the diagnosis with
                
- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a blood test  - imaging tests  - a liver biopsy
                
medical and family history. taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cirrhosis. he or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.
                
physical exam. a physical exam may help diagnose cirrhosis. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body
                
the health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. for example, the liver may feel hard or ascites may cause the abdomen to enlarge.
                
blood test. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. blood tests can show abnormal liver enzyme levels or abnormal numbers of blood cells or platelets.
                
blood tests can help find the cause in people with diagnosed cirrhosis. for example, a health care provider may use blood tests to diagnose hepatitis b and c.
                
health care providers use three blood tests to measure the severity of cirrhosis:
                
- bilirubin, which tests the amount of bile pigment in the blood  - creatinine, which tests kidney function  - international normalized ratio, which tests the bloods ability to clot
                
the results of these blood tests are used to calculate the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score. experts developed the meld score to predict the 90-day survival rate of people with end-stage liver disease. meld scores usually range between 6 and 40, with a score of 6 indicating the best likelihood of 90-day survival. the meld score is used to determine whether a person is eligible for liver transplantation.
                
imaging tests. imaging tests can show signs of advanced cirrhosis, such as irregularities in the liver surface, gastric varices, and splenomegaly. these tests can also detect signs of complications, such as ascites and liver cancer.
                
- ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. a patient does not need anesthesia.  - computerized tomography (ct) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. for a ct scan, a technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where the technician takes the x rays. an x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. a patient does not need anesthesia.  - magnetic resonance imaging (mri) machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. a patient does not need anesthesia, though a health care provider may use light sedation for patients with a fear of confined spaces. an mri may include the injection of contrast medium. with most mri machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space.  - elastography, also called liver stiffness measurement, uses either ultrasound or mri to measure the stiffness of the liver. scar tissue increases the stiffness of the liver. elastography can show how much scarring is present with some reliability. elastography is a relatively new test. however, this test promises to be helpful in showing how severe liver scarring is and whether the scarring is getting worse over time.
                
liver biopsy. a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. the health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.
                
during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. the health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. if needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. the health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. he or she may use ultrasound, ct scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. after the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
a health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. the health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab, where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaseslooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider.
                
a liver biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis; however, a person does not always need this test. a health care provider will perform a biopsy if the result might help determine the cause or affect treatment. sometimes a health care provider finds a cause of liver damage other than cirrhosis during biopsy."
what to do for proctitis ?,"drinking plenty of fluids is important when diarrhea or frequent passage of loose or liquid stools occurs.
                
avoiding caffeine and foods that are greasy, high in fiber, or sweet may lessen diarrhea symptoms. some people also have problems digesting lactosethe sugar found in milk and milk productsduring or after a bout of diarrhea. yogurt, which has less lactose than milk, is often better tolerated. yogurt with active, live bacterial cultures may even help people recover from diarrhea more quickly.
                
if diarrhea symptoms improve, soft, bland foods can be added to the diet, including bananas, plain rice, boiled potatoes, toast, crackers, cooked carrots, and baked chicken without the skin or fat. if the diarrhea stops, a normal diet may be resumed if tolerated."
what are the treatments for congenital hypothyroidism ?,"these resources address the diagnosis or management of congenital hypothyroidism:  - baby's first test  - genetic testing registry: congenital hypothyroidism  - genetic testing registry: hypothyroidism, congenital, nongoitrous, 1  - medlineplus encyclopedia: congenital hypothyroidism   these resources from medlineplus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - diagnostic tests  - drug therapy  - surgery and rehabilitation  - genetic counseling   - palliative care"
what is (are) spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 ?,"spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (smard1) is an inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and respiratory failure typically beginning in infancy. early features of this condition are difficult and noisy breathing, especially when inhaling; a weak cry; problems feeding; and recurrent episodes of pneumonia. typically between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months, infants with this condition will experience a sudden inability to breathe due to paralysis of the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm). normally, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward during inhalation to allow the lungs to expand. with diaphragm paralysis, affected individuals require life-long support with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). rarely, children with smard1 develop signs or symptoms of the disorder later in childhood.  soon after respiratory failure occurs, individuals with smard1 develop muscle weakness in their distal muscles. these are the muscles farther from the center of the body, such as muscles in the hands and feet. the weakness soon spreads to all muscles; however, within 2 years, the muscle weakness typically stops getting worse. some individuals may retain a low level of muscle function, while others lose all ability to move their muscles. muscle weakness severely impairs motor development, such as sitting, standing, and walking. some affected children develop an abnormal side-to-side and back-to-front curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together). after approximately the first year of life, individuals with smard1 may lose their deep tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer.  other features of smard1 can include reduced pain sensitivity, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), loss of bladder and bowel control, and an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)."
how to diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   complete blood count (cbc) with differential : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                -  the number of red blood cells and platelets.      - the number and type of white blood cells.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   immunophenotyping : a laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see if they are lymphocytes or myeloid cells. if the cells are malignant lymphocytes (cancer), they are checked to see if they are b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes.    -   fish (fluorescence in situ hybridization): a laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. pieces of dna that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. when these pieces of dna bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light.     -   flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light.    -   igvh gene mutation test: a laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for an igvh gene mutation. patients with an igvh gene mutation have a better prognosis.    -   bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. a pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells."
what is the outlook for sydenham chorea ?,"most children recover completely from sd, although a small number will continue to have disabling, persistent chorea despite treatment. the duration of symptoms varies, generally from 3 to 6 weeks, but some children will have symptoms for several months. cardiac complications may occur in a small minority of children, usually in the form of endocarditis. in a third of the children with the disease, sd will recur, typically 1  to 2  years after the initial attack. researchers have noted an association between recurrent sd and the later development of the abrupt onset forms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorders, and autism, which they call pandas, for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus infection. further studies are needed to determine the nature of the association and the biological pathways that connect streptococcal infection, autoimmune response, and the later development of these specific behavioral disorders."
what are the treatments for thyrotoxic myopathy ?,"treatment involves restoring normal levels of thyroid hormone and may include thyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and sometimes partial or complete surgical removal of the thyroid."

what is the outlook for joubert syndrome ?,"the prognosis for infants with joubert syndrome depends on whether or not the cerebellar vermis is partially developed or entirely absent, as well as on the extent and severity of other organ involvement, such as the kidneys and liver. some children have a mild form of the disorder, with minimal motor disability and good mental development, while others may have severe motor disability, moderate impaired mental development, and multi-organ impairments."
what are the treatments for balance problems ?,"your doctor can recommend strategies to help reduce the effects of a balance disorder. scientists are studying ways to develop new, more effective methods to treat and prevent balance disorders. balance disorders can be signs of other health problems, such as an ear infection, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. in some cases, you can help treat a balance disorder by seeking medical treatment for the illness that is causing the disorder. exercises for balance disorders some exercises help make up for a balance disorder by moving the head and body in certain ways. the exercises are developed especially for a patient by a professional (often a physical therapist) who understands the balance system and its relationship with other systems in the body. in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or bppv, small calcium particles in the inner ear become displaced, causing dizziness. bppv can often be effectively treated by carefully moving the head and torso to move the displaced calcium particles back to their original position. for some people, one session will be all that is needed. others might need to repeat the procedure several times at home to relieve their dizziness. treating mnire's disease mnire's disease is caused by changes in fluid volumes in the inner ear. people with mnire's disease can help reduce its dizzying effects by lowering the amount of sodium, or salt (sodium) in their diets. limiting alcohol or caffeine also may be helpful.  see suggestions for limiting salt (sodium) in your diet. medications such as corticosteroids and the antibiotic gentamicin are used to treat mnire's disease. gentamicin can help reduce the dizziness that occurs with mnire's disease, but in some cases it can also destroy sensory cells in the inner ear, resulting in permanent hearing loss. corticosteroids don't cause hearing loss, but research is underway to determine if they are as effective as gentamicin. learn more about ways to treat mnire's disease. in some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve a balance disorder. treating problems due to high or low blood pressure balance problems due to high blood pressure can be managed by eating less salt (sodium), maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising. balance problems due to low blood pressure may be managed by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, avoiding alcohol, and being cautious regarding your body's posture and movement, such as standing up slowly and avoiding crossing your legs when youre seated. learn more about managing high blood pressure (hypertension).   learn more about managing low blood pressure (hypotension).  coping with a balance disorder some people with a balance disorder may not be able to fully relieve their dizziness and will need to find ways to cope with it. a vestibular rehabilitation therapist can help you develop an individualized treatment plan. talk to your doctor about whether its safe to drive, as well as ways to lower your risk of falling and getting hurt during daily activities, such as when you walk up or down stairs, use the bathroom, or exercise. to reduce your risk of injury from dizziness, avoid walking in the dark. you should also wear low-heeled shoes or walking shoes outdoors. if necessary, use a cane or walker and modify conditions at your home and workplace, such as by adding handrails. current research scientists are working to understand the complex interactions between the brain and the part of the inner ear responsible for balance. they are also studying the effectiveness of certain exercises as a treatment option for balance disorders. in a study funded by the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd), researchers created a virtual reality grocery store. this virtual store is a computer-simulated environment that seems to be a physical place in the real world, designed so people with balance disorders can safely walk on a treadmill as they practice looking for items on store shelves. the goal is to help reduce a person's dizziness in confusing environments. nidcd-supported scientists are also studying the use of a vestibular implant to stop a mnires attack by restoring normal electrical activity in the vestibular nerve. this nerve conveys balance information to the brain. the device uses the same technology found in a cochlear implant, a medical device that currently provides a sense of sound to people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. an nidcd-supported clinical trial in benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (bppv) showed that repositioning maneuvers work well, and offered clinicians a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited to each individuals unique needs. see more information about research on balance problems."
what is (are) nuclear gene-encoded leigh syndrome ?,"nuclear gene-encoded leigh syndrome is a progressive neurological disease. it usually first becomes apparent in infancy with developmental delay or regression. rarely, the disease begins in adolescence or adulthood. symptoms progress to include generalized weakness, lack of muscle tone, spasticity, movement disorders, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. other signs and symptoms may include an increase in the heart muscle size (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); excessive body hair (hypertrichosis); anemia; kidney or liver problems; and lung or heart failure. nuclear gene-encoded leigh syndrome (and leigh-like syndrome, a term used for cases with similar features but that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for leigh syndrome) may be caused by mutations in any of several genes and can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or x-linked manner. while treatment for some cases of leigh-like syndrome may be available, management is generally supportive and focuses on the symptoms present."
what is (are) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"key points
                    - chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).    - leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.    - older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia.    - signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness.     - tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia.    - certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).
                
                
                    chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
                    chronic lymphocytic leukemia (also called cll) is a blood and bone marrow disease that usually gets worse slowly. cll is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. it often occurs during or after middle age; it rarely occurs in children.
                
                
                    leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    normally, the body makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. a blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   a myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  white blood cells that fight infection and disease.     -  platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.        a lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  b lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  t lymphocytes that help b lymphocytes make antibodies to fight infection.    -  natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         in cll, too many blood stem cells become abnormal lymphocytes and do not become healthy white blood cells. the abnormal lymphocytes may also be called leukemia cells. the lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well. also, as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. this may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding.    this summary is about chronic lymphocytic leukemia. see the following pdq summaries for more information about leukemia:          -  adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.    -  childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.    -  adult acute myeloid leukemia treatment.    -  childhood acute myeloid leukemia/other myeloid malignancies treatment.    -  chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment.    -  hairy cell leukemia treatment."

as the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks. in documented outbreaks of cchf, fatality rates in hospitalized patients have ranged from 9% to as high as 50%. 
                
the long-term effects of cchf infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. however, recovery is slow."
what are the signs and symptoms of rabies?,"the first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. these symptoms may last for days.
                
there may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. as the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.
                
the acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
                
disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.
                
once a person begins to exhibit signs of the disease, survival is rare. to date less than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported and only two have not had a history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis."
what is (are) loin pain hematuria syndrome ?,"loin pain hematuria syndrome (lphs) is a condition that is characterized by persistent or recurrent loin pain and hematuria (blood in the urine). other signs and symptoms include nausea and vomiting; a low-grade fever (up to 101f); and/or dysuria during episodes of pain. the exact underlying cause of lphs is currently unknown; however, scientists suspect that it may be due to abnormalities of the glomerular basement membranes (the tissues in the kidney that filter blood); bleeding disorders; or crystal and/or stone formation in the kidneys. treatment is symptomatic and usually consists of pain management."
what is (are) refsum disease ?,"refsum disease is an inherited condition that causes vision loss, absence of the sense of smell (anosmia), and a variety of other signs and symptoms.  the vision loss associated with refsum disease is caused by an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. this disorder affects the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. the first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which often becomes apparent in childhood. over a period of years, the disease disrupts side (peripheral) vision and may eventually lead to blindness.  vision loss and anosmia are seen in almost everyone with refsum disease, but other signs and symptoms vary. about one-third of affected individuals are born with bone abnormalities of the hands and feet. features that appear later in life can include progressive muscle weakness and wasting; poor balance and coordination (ataxia); hearing loss; and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). additionally, some people with refsum disease develop an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and related heart problems that can be life-threatening."
is myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers inherited ?,"is myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers genetic? if so, how is it inherited? merrf is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial dna and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. it is called maternal inheritance because a child inherits the great majority of their mitochondria from their mother through the egg.   the centre for genetics education provides a detail description of maternal inheritance.  the mother of an individual with merrf usually has a mitochondrial mutation and may or may not have symptoms.  or, an individual with merrf may have a mitochondrial mutation that just occurred in them, called a de novo mutation.  if the mother has the mitochondrial mutation, all of her children will inherit the mutation and may or may not have symptoms.  all of her daughters children will also inherit the mitochondrial mutation.  her son's children are not at risk of inheriting the mutation."
what is (are) brain aneurysm ?,"a brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ""ballooning"" in the wall of an artery in the brain. they are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often the size of a small berry. most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they become large, begin to leak blood, or burst.    if a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain, it can cause signs and symptoms. these can include       - a droopy eyelid     - double vision or other changes in vision     - pain above or behind the eye     - a dilated pupil     - numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body        treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, whether it is infected, and whether it has burst. if a brain aneurysm bursts, symptoms can include a sudden, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, loss of consciousness, and signs of a stroke. any of these symptoms requires immediate medical attention.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"

what are the genetic changes related to spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy ?,"sma-pme is caused by mutations in the asah1 gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid ceramidase. this enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are cell compartments that digest and recycle materials. within lysosomes, acid ceramidase breaks down fats called ceramides into a fat called sphingosine and a fatty acid. these two breakdown products are recycled to create new ceramides for the body to use. ceramides have several roles within cells. for example, they are a component of a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerve cells.  asah1 gene mutations that cause sma-pme result in a reduction of acid ceramidase activity to a level less than one-third of normal. inefficient breakdown of ceramides and impaired production of its breakdown products likely play a role in the nerve cell damage that leads to the features of sma-pme, but the exact mechanism is unknown."
what are the genetic changes related to doors syndrome ?,"doors syndrome can be caused by mutations in the tbc1d24 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein whose specific function in the cell is unclear. studies suggest the protein may have several roles in cells. the tbc1d24 protein belongs to a group of proteins that are involved in the movement (transport) of vesicles, which are small sac-like structures that transport proteins and other materials within cells. research suggests that the tbc1d24 protein may also help cells respond to oxidative stress. oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that can damage or kill cells. studies indicate that the tbc1d24 protein is active in a variety of organs and tissues; it is particularly active in the brain and likely plays an important role in normal brain development. the tbc1d24 protein is also active in specialized structures called stereocilia. in the inner ear, stereocilia project from certain cells called hair cells. the stereocilia bend in response to sound waves, which is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses.  tbc1d24 gene mutations that cause doors syndrome are thought to reduce or eliminate the function of the tbc1d24 protein, but the specific mechanism by which loss of tbc1d24 function leads to the signs and symptoms of doors syndrome is not well understood.  in about half of affected individuals, no tbc1d24 gene mutation has been identified. the cause of doors syndrome in these individuals is unknown."
what causes growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease ?,"researchers have found that many factors cause growth failure in children with ckd. in addition to removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood, the kidneys perform important functions for a childs growth. understanding normal kidney function and growth helps families understand what causes growth failure in children with ckd.
                
normal kidney function helps maintain the
                
- balance of nutrients and minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, in the blood. these minerals are essential for normal bone growth. the kidneys use a hormone called calcitriol, a form of vitamin d, to help bones absorb the right amount of calcium from the blood. the kidneys also remove extra phosphorus, helping balance phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood.  - bodys ability to use growth hormone. growth hormone is necessary during childhood to help bones grow and stay healthy. the pituitary gland naturally produces growth hormone, which acts as a messenger to help the body grow. growth hormone tells the liver to produce another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor, that travels to muscles, organs, and bones and tells them to grow.  - correct levels of erythropoietin in the body. erythropoietin is a hormone that helps bone marrow make red blood cells.  - proper balance of sodium, also called salt; potassium; and acid-base levels in the blood. acid-base balance refers to the amount of acid in the blood.
                
damaged kidneys can slow a childs growth by
                
- causing mineral and bone disorder, which occurs when      - vitamin d is not turned into calcitriol, which starves the bones of calcium.    - phosphorus levels rise in the blood and draw calcium out of the bones and into the blood, causing the bones to weaken.    - creating an imbalance of sodium, potassium, and acid-base levels in the blood, also called acidosis. when blood is not balanced, the body slows growth to focus energy on restoring the balance.  - decreasing appetite. a child with ckd may not be hungry, or he or she may not have the energy to eat, which may lead to poor nutrition and slower growth.  - decreasing the production of erythropoietin. when erythropoietin levels are low, a child may develop anemiaa condition that develops when the blood does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. anemia can cause growth to slow or stop.  - making an abnormally large amount of urine, called polyuria, which disrupts the bodys fluid balance. a child with polyuria loses minerals as well. the body slows growth to make up for the lost fluid and minerals.  - preventing the body from correctly using growth hormone. when the kidneys are damaged, waste builds up in the blood and the body does not properly process growth hormone."

what is (are) cystocele ?,"a cystocele, also called a prolapsed or dropped bladder, is the bulging or dropping of the bladder into the vagina. the bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. during urination, also called voiding, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. the urethra is the tube that carries urine outside of the body. the vagina is the tube in a womans body that runs beside the urethra and connects the womb, or uterus, to the outside of the body."
what are the genetic changes related to pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome ?,"pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is caused by defects in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. this process is called oxidative phosphorylation. although most dna is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus (nuclear dna), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own dna, called mitochondrial dna (mtdna). this type of dna contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is caused by single, large deletions of mtdna, which can range from 1,000 to 10,000 dna building blocks (nucleotides). the most common deletion, which occurs in about 20 percent of affected individuals, removes 4,997 nucleotides.  the mtdna deletions involved in pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome result in the loss of genes that provide instructions for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. these deletions impair oxidative phosphorylation and decrease the energy available to cells. it is not clear how loss of mtdna leads to the specific signs and symptoms of pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome, although the features of the condition are likely related to a lack of cellular energy."
what are the genetic changes related to spondylothoracic dysostosis ?,"the mesp2 gene provides instructions for a protein that plays a critical role in the development of vertebrae. specifically, it is involved in separating vertebrae from one another during early development, a process called somite segmentation. mutations in the mesp2 gene prevent the production of any protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. when the mesp2 protein is nonfunctional or absent, somite segmentation does not occur properly, which results in the malformation and fusion of the bones of the spine and ribs seen in spondylothoracic dysostosis."
what are the genetic changes related to paget disease of bone ?,"a combination of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing paget disease of bone. researchers have identified changes in several genes that increase the risk of the disorder. other factors, including infections with certain viruses, may be involved in triggering the disease in people who are at risk. however, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of paget disease of bone remains unclear.  researchers have identified variations in three genes that are associated with paget disease of bone: sqstm1, tnfrsf11a, and tnfrsf11b. mutations in the sqstm1 gene are the most common genetic cause of classic paget disease of bone, accounting for 10 to 50 percent of cases that run in families and 5 to 30 percent of cases in which there is no family history of the disease. variations in the tnfrsf11b gene also appear to increase the risk of the classic form of the disorder, particularly in women. tnfrsf11a mutations cause the early-onset form of paget disease of bone.  the sqstm1, tnfrsf11a, and tnfrsf11b genes are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy. paget disease of bone disrupts the bone remodeling process. affected bone is broken down abnormally and then replaced much faster than usual. when the new bone tissue grows, it is larger, weaker, and less organized than normal bone. it is unclear why these problems with bone remodeling affect some bones but not others in people with this disease.  researchers are looking for additional genes that may influence a person's chances of developing paget disease of bone. studies suggest that genetic variations in certain regions of chromosome 2, chromosome 5, and chromosome 10 appear to contribute to disease risk. however, the associated genes on these chromosomes have not been identified."
who is at risk for laryngeal cancer? ?,use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.
what causes diabetic neuropathies: the nerve damage of diabetes ?,"the causes are probably different for different types of diabetic neuropathy. researchers are studying how prolonged exposure to high blood glucose causes nerve damage. nerve damage is likely due to a combination of factors:
                
- metabolic factors, such as high blood glucose, long duration of diabetes, abnormal blood fat levels, and possibly low levels of insulin  - neurovascular factors, leading to damage to the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to nerves  - autoimmune factors that cause inflammation in nerves  - mechanical injury to nerves, such as carpal tunnel syndrome  - inherited traits that increase susceptibility to nerve disease  - lifestyle factors, such as smoking or alcohol use"
what to do for crohn's disease ?,"researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition cause crohn's disease symptoms. good nutrition is important in the management of crohn's disease, however. dietary changes can help reduce symptoms. a health care provider may recommend that a person make dietary changes such as
                
- avoiding carbonated drinks  - avoiding popcorn, vegetable skins, nuts, and other high-fiber foods  - drinking more liquids  - eating smaller meals more often  - keeping a food diary to help identify troublesome foods
                
health care providers may recommend nutritional supplements and vitamins for people who do not absorb enough nutrients.
                
to help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.
                
depending on a person's symptoms or medications, a health care provider may recommend a specific diet, such as a
                
- high-calorie diet  - lactose-free diet  - low-fat diet  - low-fiber diet  - low-salt diet
                
people should speak with a health care provider about specific dietary recommendations and changes."
what is (are) sitosterolemia ?,"sitosterolemia is a condition in which fatty substances (lipids) from vegetable oils, nuts, and other plant-based foods accumulate in the blood and tissues. these lipids are called plant sterols (or phytosterols). sitosterol is one of several plant sterols that accumulate in this disorder, with a blood level 30 to 100 times greater than normal. cholesterol, a similar fatty substance found in animal products, is mildly to moderately elevated in many people with sitosterolemia. cholesterol levels are particularly high in some affected children.  plant sterols are not produced by the body; they are taken in as components of foods. signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia begin to appear early in life after foods containing plant sterols are introduced into the diet.  an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis) may occur by adolescence or early adulthood in people with sitosterolemia. the deposits narrow the arteries and can eventually block blood flow, increasing the chance of a heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.  people with sitosterolemia typically develop small yellowish growths called xanthomas beginning in childhood. the xanthomas consist of accumulated lipids and may be located anywhere on or just under the skin, typically on the heels, knees, elbows, and buttocks. they may also occur in the bands that connect muscles to bones (tendons), including tendons of the hand and the tendon that connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles (the achilles tendon). large xanthomas can cause pain, difficulty with movement, and cosmetic problems.  joint stiffness and pain resulting from plant sterol deposits may also occur in individuals with sitosterolemia. less often, affected individuals have blood abnormalities. occasionally the blood abnormalities are the only signs of the disorder. the red blood cells may be broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). this type of anemia is called hemolytic anemia. affected individuals sometimes have abnormally shaped red blood cells called stomatocytes. in addition, the blood cells involved in clotting, called platelets or thrombocytes, may be abnormally large (macrothrombocytopenia)."
what are the treatments for growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease ?,"health care providers treat growth failure in children with ckd with
                
- changes in eating, diet, and nutrition  - medications  - growth hormone therapy
                
most children with growth failure grow to about one-third of their adult height within the first two years of life; therefore, it is important to start treatment for growth failure early.1"
how to diagnose hemoglobin e disease ?,"how is hemoglobin e disease diagnosed? many babies are picked up through state newborn screening programs. a diagnosis is usually made by looking at the red blood cells by doing a mean corpuscular volume (mcv) test, which is commonly part of a complete blood count (cbc) test. more specialized tests, such as a hemoglobin electrophoresis and iron studies might be done. these tests indicate whether a person has different types of hemoglobin. genetic testing of the hbb gene can also be done to confirm a diagnosis."
what are the genetic changes related to behet disease ?,"the cause of behet disease is unknown. the condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. however, a particular variation in the hla-b gene has been strongly associated with the risk of developing behet disease.  the hla-b gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. the hla-b gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). the hla-b gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. a variation of the hla-b gene called hla-b51 increases the risk of developing behet disease. although many people with behet disease have the hla-b51 variation, most people with this version of the hla-b gene never develop the disorder. it is unknown how hla-b51 increases the risk of developing behet disease.  researchers have considered many other genetic and environmental factors as possible contributors to behet disease. studies have examined several genes related to immune system function, although no gene except hla-b has been definitively associated with an increased risk of behet disease. it appears likely that environmental factors, such as certain bacterial or viral infections, play a role in triggering the disease in people who are at risk. however, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of this complex disorder remains unclear."
what is (are) hereditary lymphedema type ii ?,"hereditary lymphedema type ii is a primary lymphedema that results from abnormal transport of lymph fluid. individuals with this condition usually develop swelling in the lower legs and feet during puberty. some affected individuals develop a non-contagious skin infection called cellulitis, which can further damage the lymphatic vessels (the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid). while the cause of hereditary lymphedema type ii is unknown, it is thought to be genetic because it tends to run in families. it appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
what to do for intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing intestinal pseudo-obstruction. following special diets usually does not help improve the disorder. however, eating frequent, small meals with pureed foods or liquids may ease digestion. vitamin and trace mineral supplements may help a person who is malnourished."

what is (are) paresthesia ?,"paresthesia refers to a burning or prickling sensation that is usually felt in the hands, arms, legs, or feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. the sensation, which happens without warning, is usually painless and described as tingling or numbness, skin crawling, or itching.  most people have experienced temporary paresthesia -- a feeling of ""pins and needles"" -- at some time in their lives when they have sat with legs crossed for too long, or fallen asleep with an arm crooked under their head. it happens when sustained pressure is placed on a nerve. the feeling quickly goes away once the pressure is relieved.  chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological disease or traumatic nerve damage. paresthesia can be caused by disorders affecting the central nervous system, such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes), multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis. a tumor or vascular lesion pressed up against the brain or spinal cord can also cause paresthesia. nerve entrapment syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can damage peripheral nerves and cause paresthesia accompanied by pain. diagnostic evaluation is based on determining the underlying condition causing the paresthetic sensations. an individual's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are essential for the diagnosis. physicians may order additional tests depending on the suspected cause of the paresthesia."
what are the treatments for gilbert syndrome ?,"how might gilbert syndrome be treated? gilbert syndrome generally doesn't require treatment. the bilirubin levels in the blood may fluctuate over time, causing episodes of jaundice. however, the jaundice is usually mild and goes away on its own. in some cases, doctors may prescribe phenobarbital to lower extremely elevated bilirubin levels and reduce signs of jaundice. phenobarbital administration usually alleviates signs of jaundice fairly quickly."
what is (are) endocarditis ?,"endocarditis (en-do-kar-di-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. this lining is called the endocardium (en-do-kar-de-um). the condition also is called infective endocarditis (ie).
                
the term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. this article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.
                
ie occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. the infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.
                
ie can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. when ie develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. when it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.
                
overview
                
ie mainly affects people who have:
                
damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
                
congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
                
implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
                
people who have normal heart valves also can have ie. however, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.
                
certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. these factors put you at higher risk for ie. for example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection.
                
other risk factors include using intravenous (iv) drugs, having a catheter (tube) or another medical device in your body for long periods, and having a history of ie.
                
common symptoms of ie are fever and other flu-like symptoms. because the infection can affect people in different ways, the signs and symptoms vary. ie also can cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart.
                
if you're at high risk for ie, seek medical care if you have signs or symptoms of the infection, especially a fever that persists or unexplained fatigue (tiredness).
                
outlook
                
ie is treated with antibiotics for several weeks. you also may need heart surgery to repair or replace heart valves or remove infected heart tissue.
                
most people who are treated with the proper antibiotics recover. but if the infection isn't treated, or if it persists despite treatment (for example, if the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics), it's usually fatal.
                
if you have signs or symptoms of ie, see your doctor as soon as you can, especially if you have abnormal heart valves."

what is (are) dentinogenesis imperfecta ?,"dentinogenesis imperfecta is a condition that results in issues with tooth development, causing the teeth to be translucent and discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown in color). individuals with this disorder tend to have teeth that are weaker than normal which leads to increased wear, breakage, and loss of the teeth. this can affect both primary (baby) and permanent teeth. dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the dspp gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. there are three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta. type i: occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle, causing them to break easily. type ii and type iii: usually occur in people without another inherited disorder. some families with type ii also have progressive hearing loss. type iii was first identified in a population in brandywine, maryland. some researchers believe that dentinogenesis imperfecta type ii and type iii, along with a similar condition called dentin dysplasia type ii, are actually just different forms of a single disorder."
is beta-mannosidosis inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) gas ?,"everyone has gas. most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping. passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. most of the time gas does not have an odor. the odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.    gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine. certain foods may cause gas. foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.    you can reduce the amount of gas you have by       - drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks    - eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat    - avoiding milk products if you have lactose intolerance       medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. if your symptoms still bother you, see your health care provider.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
how many people are affected by klinefelter syndrome ?,"klinefelter syndrome affects 1 in 500 to 1,000 newborn males. most variants of klinefelter syndrome are much rarer, occurring in 1 in 50,000 or fewer newborns.  researchers suspect that klinefelter syndrome is underdiagnosed because the condition may not be identified in people with mild signs and symptoms. additionally, the features of the condition vary and overlap significantly with those of other conditions."
what is (are) addison disease ?,"your adrenal glands are just above your kidneys. the outside layer of these glands makes hormones that help your body respond to stress and regulate your blood pressure and water and salt balance. addison disease happens if the adrenal glands don't make enough of these hormones.    a problem with your immune system usually causes addison disease. the immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues, damaging your adrenal glands. other causes include infections and cancer.    symptoms include       - weight loss     - muscle weakness     - fatigue that gets worse over time     - low blood pressure     - patchy or dark skin        lab tests can confirm that you have addison disease. if you don't treat it, it can be fatal. you will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life. if you have addison disease, you should carry an emergency id. it should say that you have the disease, list your medicines and say how much you need in an emergency.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"

what causes angina ?,"underlying causes
                
angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (chd). this means that the underlying causes of angina generally are the same as the underlying causes of chd.
                
research suggests that chd starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. these factors include:
                
smoking
                
high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood
                
high blood pressure
                
high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes
                
plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. when plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-o-sis).
                
plaque narrows or blocks the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. some plaque is hard and stable and causes the arteries to become narrow and stiff. this can greatly reduce blood flow to the heart and cause angina.
                
other plaque is soft and more likely to rupture (break open) and cause blood clots. blood clots can partially or totally block the coronary arteries and cause angina or a heart attack.
                
immediate causes
                
many factors can trigger angina pain, depending on the type of angina you have.
                
stable angina
                
physical exertion is the most common trigger of stable angina. severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you're sitting.
                
however, with physical exertionlike walking up a hill or climbing stairsthe heart works harder and needs more oxygen.
                
other triggers of stable angina include:
                
emotional stress
                
exposure to very hot or cold temperatures
                
heavy meals
                
smoking
                
unstable angina
                
blood clots that partially or totally block an artery cause unstable angina.
                
if plaque in an artery ruptures, blood clots may form. this creates a blockage. a clot may grow large enough to completely block the artery and cause a heart attack. for more information, go to the animation in ""what causes a heart attack?""
                
blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again. angina can occur each time a clot blocks an artery.
                
variant angina
                
a spasm in a coronary artery causes variant angina. the spasm causes the walls of the artery to tighten and narrow. blood flow to the heart slows or stops. variant angina can occur in people who have chd and in those who dont.
                
the coronary arteries can spasm as a result of:
                
exposure to cold
                
emotional stress
                
medicines that tighten or narrow blood vessels
                
smoking
                
cocaine use
                
microvascular angina
                
this type of angina may be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (mvd). coronary mvd is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries.
                
reduced blood flow in the small coronary arteries may cause microvascular angina. plaque in the arteries, artery spasms, or damaged or diseased artery walls can reduce blood flow through the small coronary arteries."
what is (are) tracheoesophageal fistula ?,"tracheoesophageal fistula (tef) is a life-threatening condition in which there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and trachea (windpipe). the esophagus and trachea run next to each other through the chest cavity. the esophagus carries food and saliva to the stomach, while the trachea carries air to the lungs. tef can lead to severe and fatal lung complications. saliva and gastric secretions can be aspirated into the lungs, and normal swallowing and digestion of food cannot occur. most affected people are diagnosed immediately after birth or during infancy. symptoms may include frothy bubbles of mucus in the mouth and nose; episodes of coughing and choking; and worsening symptoms during feeding. tef may be isolated, or it may occur with other physical or developmental abnormalities (most commonly, esophageal atresia). in many cases the cause is unknown but it has been associated with some chromosome disorders. in some cases it may be acquired later in life after a cancer, infection, ruptured diverticula, or trauma. treatment includes immediate surgical repair with survival rates of almost 100%."
what is (are) dry mouth ?,"dry mouth is the feeling that there is not enough saliva in your mouth. everyone has a dry mouth once in a while - if they are nervous, upset or under stress. but if you have a dry mouth all or most of the time, it can be uncomfortable and can lead to serious health problems.    symptoms of dry mouth include       - a sticky, dry feeling in the mouth    - trouble chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking    - a burning feeling in the mouth    - a dry feeling in the throat    - cracked lips    - a dry, rough tongue    - mouth sores    - an infection in the mouth       dry mouth is not a normal part of aging. causes include some medicines, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and nerve damage. salivary gland diseases, sjogren's syndrome, hiv/aids, and diabetes can also cause dry mouth. treatment depends on the cause. things you can do include sipping water, avoiding drinks with caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol, and chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless hard candy.    nih: national institute of dental and craniofacial research"

is lesch nyhan syndrome inherited ?,"how is lesch nyhan syndrome inherited? lesch nyhan syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive manner. a condition is x-linked if the changed (mutated) gene responsible for the condition is located on the x chromosome. the x chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes; females have two x chromosomes, and males have one x and one y chromosome. females who have one mutated copy of the responsible gene (on one of their x chromosomes) usually do not have the condition and are referred to as carriers. this is because they still have a working copy of the responsible gene on their other x chromosome. males with one mutated copy of the responsible gene have signs and symptoms of the condition (they are affected) because they do not have another x chromosome with a working copy of the gene. this is why x-linked recessive disorders, including lesch nyhan syndrome, occur much more frequently in males. lesch nyhan syndrome is caused by mutations in the hprt1 gene. a female who is a carrier of lesch nyhan syndrome has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated hprt1 gene in each pregnancy. this is because a carrier female will randomly pass on one of her x chromosome to each child. sons who inherit the mutated gene will be affected, and daughters who inherit the mutated gene will be carriers. this means that with each pregnancy, a female who is a carrier has a: 50% (1 in 2) chance of having an unaffected son or daughter 25% (1 in 4) chance of having an affected son 25% chance of having a carrier daughter"
what are the treatments for shingles ?,"the severity and duration of an attack of shingles can be significantly reduced by immediate treatment with antiviral drugs, which include acyclovir, valcyclovir, or famcyclovir. antiviral drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. other treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include steroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants (including pregabalin and gabapentin enacarbil), and topical agents. the varicella zoster virus vaccine (zostavax) has been approved by teh food and drug administration for adults age 50 and older. researchers found that giving older adults the vaccine reduced the expected number of later cases of shingles by half. and in people who still got the disease despite immunization, the severity and complications of shingles were dramatically reduced. the shingles vaccine is a preventive therapy and not a treatment for those who already have shingles or long-lasting nerve pain (postherpetic neuralgia)."
what causes inguinal hernia ?,"the cause of inguinal hernias depends on the type of inguinal hernia.
                
indirect inguinal hernias. a defect in the abdominal wall that is present at birth causes an indirect inguinal hernia.
                
during the development of the fetus in the womb, the lining of the abdominal cavity forms and extends into the inguinal canal. in males, the spermatic cord and testicles descend out from inside the abdomen and through the abdominal lining to the scrotum through the inguinal canal. next, the abdominal lining usually closes off the entrance to the inguinal canal a few weeks before or after birth. in females, the ovaries do not descend out from inside the abdomen, and the abdominal lining usually closes a couple of months before birth.1
                
sometimes the lining of the abdomen does not close as it should, leaving an opening in the abdominal wall at the upper part of the inguinal canal. fat or part of the small intestine may slide into the inguinal canal through this opening, causing a hernia. in females, the ovaries may also slide into the inguinal canal and cause a hernia.
                
indirect hernias are the most common type of inguinal hernia.2 indirect inguinal hernias may appear in 2 to 3 percent of male children; however, they are much less common in female children, occurring in less than 1 percent.3
                
direct inguinal hernias. direct inguinal hernias usually occur only in male adults as aging and stress or strain weaken the abdominal muscles around the inguinal canal. previous surgery in the lower abdomen can also weaken the abdominal muscles.
                
females rarely form this type of inguinal hernia. in females, the broad ligament of the uterus acts as an additional barrier behind the muscle layer of the lower abdominal wall. the broad ligament of the uterus is a sheet of tissue that supports the uterus and other reproductive organs."
"how to prevent parasites - lice - pubic ""crab"" lice ?","pubic (""crab"") lice most commonly are spread directly from person to person by sexual contact. pubic lice very rarely may be spread by clothing, bedding, or a toilet seat.
    
the following are steps that can be taken to help prevent and control the spread of pubic (""crab"") lice:
    
     - all sexual contacts of the infested person should be examined. all those who are infested should be treated.
     - sexual contact between the infested person(s)s and their sexual partner(s) should be avoided until all have been examined, treated as necessary, and reevaluated to rule out persistent infestation.
     - machine wash and dry clothing worn and bedding used by the infested person in the hot water (at least 130°f) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. clothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.
     - do not share clothing, bedding, and towels used by an infested person.
     - do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control pubic (""crab"") lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
    
    
persons with pubic lice should be examined and treated for any other sexually transmitted diseases (stds) that may be present."

how to diagnose heart palpitations ?,"first, your doctor will want to find out whether your palpitations are harmless or related to a heart problem. he or she will ask about your symptoms and medical history, do a physical exam, and recommend several basic tests.
                
this information may point to a heart problem as the cause of your palpitations. if so, your doctor may recommend more tests. these tests will help show what the problem is, so your doctor can decide how to treat it.
                
the cause of palpitations may be hard to diagnose, especially if symptoms don't occur regularly.
                
specialists involved
                
several types of doctors may work with you to diagnose and treat your palpitations. these include a:
                
primary care doctor
                
cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions)
                
electrophysiologist (a cardiologist who specializes in the heart's electrical system)
                
medical history
                
your doctor will ask questions about your palpitations, such as:
                
when did they begin?
                
how long do they last?
                
how often do they occur?
                
do they start and stop suddenly?
                
does your heartbeat feel steady or irregular during the palpitations?
                
do other symptoms occur with the palpitations?
                
do your palpitations have a pattern? for example, do they occur when you exercise or drink coffee? do they happen at a certain time of day?
                
your doctor also may ask about your use of caffeine, alcohol, supplements, and illegal drugs.
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will take your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is normal. he or she also will use a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat.
                
your doctor may look for signs of conditions that can cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid.
                
diagnostic tests
                
often, the first test that's done is an ekg (electrocardiogram). this simple test records your heart's electrical activity.
                
an ekg shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). it also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.
                
even if your ekg results are normal, you may still have a medical condition that's causing palpitations. if your doctor suspects this is the case, you may have blood tests to gather more information about your heart's structure, function, and electrical system.
                
holter or event monitor
                
a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. it won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't happen during the test. to diagnose problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a holter or event monitor.
                
a holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. you wear patches called electrodes on your chest. wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. the recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.
                
during the 24- or 48-hour period, you do your usual daily activities. you use a notebook to record any symptoms you have and the time they occur. you then return both the recorder and the notebook to your doctor to read the results. your doctor can see how your heart was beating at the time you had symptoms.
                
an event monitor is similar to a holter monitor. you wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. however, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.
                
for many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.
                
you can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.
                
holter or event monitor
                

                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. the picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.
                
the test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.
                
stress test
                
some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. during stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. if you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast."
what causes erythromelalgia ?,"what causes erythromelalgia? about 15% of cases of erythromelalgia are caused by mutations in the scn9a gene. the scn9a gene gives instructions for making part of a sodium channel which carries sodium into cells and helps them make and transmit electrical signals. these sodium channels are found in nerve cells that transmit pain signals to the spine and brain. mutations that cause erythromelalgia cause increased transmission of pain signals, leading to the signs and symptoms of the condition. in some of these cases, an affected individual inherits the mutation from an affected parent. in other cases, a new mutation occurs for the first time in an individual with no history of the condition in the family. in the remainder of cases, the exact underlying cause is not currently known. evidence suggests that it results from abnormalities in the normal narrowing and widening of certain blood vessels, leading to abnormalities in blood flow to the hands and feet. there may be a variety of non-genetic causes, or mutations in other genes that have not yet been identified."
what are the treatments for hypersomnia ?,"treatment is symptomatic in nature. stimulants, such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil, may be prescribed. other drugs used to treat hypersomnia include clonidine, levodopa, bromocriptine, antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. changes in behavior (for example avoiding night work and social activities that delay bed time) and diet may offer some relief. patients should avoid alcohol and caffeine."
is succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) congenital short femur ?,"congenital short femur is a rare type of skeletal dysplasia, a complex group of bone and cartilage disorders that affect the skeleton of a fetus as it develops during pregnancy. congenital short femur can vary in severity, ranging from hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the femur to absence of the femur. with modern surgery techniques and expertise, lengthening the shortened femur may be an option for some patients. however surgical lengthening of the femur remains a challenging procedure with risks for complications."
how many people are affected by paget disease of bone ?,classic paget disease of bone occurs in approximately 1 percent of people older than 40 in the united states. scientists estimate that about 1 million people in this country have the disease. it is most common in people of western european heritage.  early-onset paget disease of bone is much rarer. this form of the disorder has been reported in only a few families.

what is (are) thyroglossal tract cyst ?,a thyroglossal duct cyst is a neck mass or lump that develops from cells and tissues remaining after the formation of the thyroid gland during embryonic development.
what are the treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ?,"doctors may prescribe medicines, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation (pr), and lung transplant to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf).
                
medicines
                
currently, no medicines are proven to slow the progression of ipf.
                
prednisone, azathioprine (a-zah-thi-o-preen), and n-acetylcysteine (a-seh-til-sis-tee-in) have been used to treat ipf, either alone or in combination. however, experts have not found enough evidence to support their use.
                
prednisone
                
prednisone is an anti-inflammatory medicine. you usually take it by mouth every day. however, your doctor may give it to you through a needle or tube inserted into a vein in your arm for several days. after that, you usually take it by mouth.
                
because prednisone can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it for 3 to 6 months or less at first. then, if it works for you, your doctor may reduce the dose over time and keep you on it longer.
                
azathioprine
                
azathioprine suppresses your immune system. you usually take it by mouth every day. because it can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it with prednisone for only 3 to 6 months.
                
if you don't have serious side effects and the medicines seem to help you, your doctor may keep you on them longer.
                
n-acetylcysteine
                
n-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that may help prevent lung damage. you usually take it by mouth several times a day.
                
a common treatment for ipf is a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and n-acetylcysteine. however, this treatment was recently found harmful in a study funded by the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi).
                
if you have ipf and take this combination of medicines, talk with your doctor. do not stop taking the medicines on your own.
                
the nhlbi currently supports research to compare n-acetylcysteine treatment with placebo treatment (sugar pills) in patients who have ipf.
                
new medicines being studied
                
researchers, like those in the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis network, are studying new treatments for ipf. with the support and guidance of the nhlbi, these researchers continue to look for new ipf treatments and therapies.
                
some of these researchers are studying medicines that may reduce inflammation and prevent or reduce scarring caused by ipf.
                
if you're interested in joining a research study, talk with your doctor. for more information about ongoing research, go to the ""clinical trials"" section of this article.
                
other treatments
                
other treatments that may help people who have ipf include the following:
                
flu andpneumonia vaccines may help prevent infections and keep you healthy.
                
cough medicines or oral codeine may relieve coughing.
                
vitamin d, calcium, and a bone-building medicine may help prevent bone loss if you're taking prednisone or another corticosteroid.
                
anti-reflux therapy may help control gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). most people who have ipf also have gerd.
                
oxygen therapy
                
if the amount of oxygen in your blood gets low, you may need oxygen therapy. oxygen therapy can help reduce shortness of breath and allow you to be more active.
                
oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. at first, you may need it only during exercise and sleep. as your disease worsens, you may need it all the time.
                
for more information, go to the health topics oxygen therapy article.
                
pulmonary rehabilitation
                
pr is now a standard treatment for people who have chronic (ongoing) lung disease. pr is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have breathing problems.
                
the program usually involves treatment by a team of specialists in a special clinic. the goal is to teach you how to manage your condition and function at your best.
                
pr doesn't replace medical therapy. instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:
                
exercise training
                
nutritional counseling
                
education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it
                
energy-conserving techniques
                
breathing strategies
                
psychological counseling and/or group support
                
for more information, go to the health topics pulmonary rehabilitation article.
                
lung transplant
                
your doctor may recommend a lung transplant if your condition is quickly worsening or very severe. a lung transplant can improve your quality of life and help you live longer.
                
some medical centers will consider patients older than 65 for lung transplants if they have no other serious medical problems.
                
the major complications of a lung transplant are rejection and infection. (""rejection"" refers to your body creating proteins that attack the new organ.) you will have to take medicines for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of rejection.
                
because the supply of donor lungs is limited, talk with your doctor about a lung transplant as soon as possible.
                
for more information, go to the health topics lung transplant article."
what is (are) ollier disease ?,"ollier disease is a disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. these growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet; however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine (vertebrae). enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and fractures.  the signs and symptoms of ollier disease may be detectable at birth, although they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. enchondromas develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. as a result of the bone deformities associated with ollier disease, people with this disorder generally have short stature and underdeveloped muscles.  although the enchondromas associated with ollier disease start out as benign, they may become cancerous (malignant). in particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. people with ollier disease also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer.  people with ollier disease usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is unaffected. the extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their activities.  a related disorder called maffucci syndrome also involves multiple enchondromas but is distinguished by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas)."
what is (are) carcinoid syndrome ?,"carcinoid syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that are associated with carcinoid tumors (rare, slow-growing tumors that occur most frequently in the gastroinestinal tract or lungs). affected people may experience skin flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, skin lesions on the face (telangiectasias), and wheezing. in later stages, carcinoid syndrome may damage the heart valves, resulting in symptoms of congestive heart failure. the condition occurs when the carcinoid tumor secretes serotonin or other chemicals into the bloodstream. only 10% of people with carcinoid tumors develop carcinoid syndrome; most have advanced stage carcinoid tumors that have spread to the liver. treatment generally involves addressing the underlying carcinoid tumor and medications to alleviate symptoms."
how to diagnose greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ?,"is genetic testing available for greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome? yes. gli3 is the only gene known to be associated with greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (gcps). genetic testing is available to analyze the gli3 gene for mutations. mutations involving gli3 can be identified in greater than 75% of people with gcps. how is greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome diagnosed?  greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (gcps) is diagnosed based on clinical findings and family history. major findings of gcps include: an abnormally large head size (macrocephaly) greater than the 97th percentile widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism) limb anomalies including extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) fused skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly) a diagnosis is established in a first degree relative of a known affected individual if that person has polydactyly with or without syndactyly or craniofacial features (macrocephaly, widely spaced eyes). a diagnosis is additionally established in a person who has features of gcps and a mutation in the gli3 gene."
what is (are) parasites - american trypanosomiasis (also known as chagas disease) ?,"chagas disease is caused by the parasite trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to animals and people by insect vectors that are found only in the americas (mainly, in rural areas of latin america where poverty is widespread). chagas disease (t. cruzi infection) is also referred to as american trypanosomiasis.
it is estimated that as many as 8 million people in mexico, central america, and south america have chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. if untreated, infection is lifelong and can be life threatening.
the impact of chagas disease is not limited to the rural areas in latin america in which vectorborne transmission occurs. large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of latin america and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution and changed the epidemiology of chagas disease. in the united states and in other regions where chagas disease is now found but is not endemic, control strategies should focus on preventing transmission from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and mother-to-baby (congenital transmission)."
what is (are) congenital primary aphakia ?,"congenital primary aphakia (cpa) is a rare eye condition that is present at birth in which the lens is missing. in some cases, cpa can be associated with other eye abnormalities including microphthalmia, absence of the iris, anterior segment aplasia, and/or sclerocornea (when the cornea blends with the sclera). this condition is thought to result from an abnormality during the 4th or 5th week of fetal development, which prevents the formation of any lens structure in the eye. mutations in the foxe3 gene have been associated with this condition. cpa is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. click here to view a diagram of the eye."
is russell-silver syndrome inherited ?,"most cases of russell-silver syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  less commonly, russell-silver syndrome can run in families. in some affected families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of a genetic change in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in other families, the condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of a gene are altered in each cell. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
how to diagnose chapare hemorrhagic fever (chhf) ?,"chhf virus has been successfully isolated from both blood and serum during the acute febrile phase of illness. although not undertaken at the time of the initial cluster, virus can certainly be isolated from tissue obtained post-mortem if available. a subsequent complete genomic analysis of chapare virus facilitated the development of specific molecular detection (rt-pcr) assays. 
   
serologic diagnosis of chhf can be made by indirect immunofluorescent assay and elisa. however, individuals from endemic areas who show fever, dizziness, and myalgia, accompanied by laboratory findings of low white blood cell and platelet counts and excess protein in the urine, should be suspected of having one of the south american hemorrhagic fever viruses. clinical specimens should be tested using specific assays."

what are the genetic changes related to aniridia ?,"aniridia is caused by mutations in the pax6 gene. the pax6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), and the pancreas. within the brain, the pax6 protein is involved in the development of a specialized group of brain cells that process smell (the olfactory bulb). the pax6 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes. on the basis of this role, the pax6 protein is called a transcription factor. following birth, the pax6 protein regulates several genes that likely contribute to the maintenance of different eye structures.  mutations in the pax6 gene result in the production of a nonfunctional pax6 protein that is unable to bind to dna and regulate the activity of other genes. a lack of functional pax6 protein disrupts the formation of the eyes during embryonic development."

what is the outlook for tourette syndrome ?,"although ts can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood. as a result, some individuals may actually become symptom free or no longer need medication for tic suppression."
what is (are) brachial plexus injuries ?,"the brachial plexus is a network of nerves that conducts signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand. brachial plexus injuries are caused by damage to those nerves. symptoms may include a limp or paralyzed arm; lack of muscle control in the arm, hand, or wrist; and a lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand. brachial plexus injuries can occur as a result of shoulder trauma, tumors, or inflammation. there is a rare syndrome called parsonage-turner syndrome, or brachial plexitis, which causes inflammation of the brachial plexus without any obvious shoulder injury. this syndrome can begin with severe shoulder or arm pain followed by weakness and numbness. in infants, brachial plexus injuries may happen during birth if the babys shoulder is stretched during passage in the birth canal (see brachial plexus birth injuries). 
                
the severity of a brachial plexus injury is determined by the type of damage done to the nerves. the most severe type, avulsion, is caused when the nerve root is severed or cut from the spinal cord. there is also an incomplete form of avulsion in which part of the nerve is damaged and which leaves some opportunity for the nerve to slowly recover function. neuropraxia, or stretch injury, is the mildest type of injury neuropraxia damages the protective covering of the nerve, which causes problems with nerve signal conduction, but does not always damage the nerve underneath."
what is (are) pol iii-related leukodystrophy ?,"pol iii-related leukodystrophy is a disorder that affects the nervous system and other parts of the body. leukodystrophies are conditions that involve abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. myelin insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.  pol iii-related leukodystrophy is a hypomyelinating disease, which means that the nervous system of affected individuals has a reduced ability to form myelin. hypomyelination underlies most of the neurological problems associated with pol iii-related leukodystrophy. a small number of people with this disorder also have a loss of nerve cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (cerebellar atrophy) and underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of tissue that connects the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum). these brain abnormalities likely contribute to the neurological problems in affected individuals.  people with pol iii-related leukodystrophy usually have intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe, which gradually worsens over time. some affected individuals have normal intelligence in early childhood but develop mild intellectual disability during the course of the disease.  difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which begins in childhood and slowly worsens over time, is a characteristic feature of pol iii-related leukodystrophy. affected children typically have delayed development of motor skills such as walking. their gait is unstable, and they usually walk with their feet wide apart for balance. affected individuals may eventually need to use a walker or wheelchair. involuntary rhythmic shaking (tremor) of the arms and hands may occur in this disorder. in some cases the tremor occurs mainly during movement (intentional tremor); other affected individuals experience the tremor both during movement and at rest.  development of the teeth (dentition) is often abnormal in pol iii-related leukodystrophy, resulting in the absence of some teeth (known as hypodontia or oligodontia). some affected infants are born with a few teeth (natal teeth), which fall out during the first weeks of life. the primary (deciduous) teeth appear later than usual, beginning at about age 2. in pol iii-related leukodystrophy, the teeth may not appear in the usual sequence, in which front teeth (incisors) appear before back teeth (molars). instead, molars often appear first, with incisors appearing later or not at all. permanent teeth are also delayed, and may not appear until adolescence. the teeth may also be unusually shaped.  some individuals with pol iii-related leukodystrophy have excessive salivation and difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia), which can lead to choking. they may also have speech impairment (dysarthria). people with pol iii-related leukodystrophy often have abnormalities in eye movement, such as progressive vertical gaze palsy, which is restricted up-and-down eye movement that worsens over time. nearsightedness is common in affected individuals, and clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts) has also been reported. deterioration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerves) and seizures may also occur in this disorder.  hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development, may occur in pol iii-related leukodystrophy. affected individuals have delayed development of the typical signs of puberty, such as the growth of body hair.  people with pol iii-related leukodystrophy may have different combinations of its signs and symptoms. these varied combinations of clinical features were originally described as separate disorders. affected individuals may be diagnosed with ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (addh); hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4h syndrome); tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (tach); leukodystrophy with oligodontia (lo); or hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (hcahc). because these disorders were later found to have the same genetic cause, researchers now group them as variations of the single condition pol iii-related leukodystrophy."
how to prevent atherosclerosis ?,"taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors youhave.
                
one step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include:
                
heart-healthy eating. adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. a heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
                
physical activity. be as physically active as you can. physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. read more about physical activity and your heart.
                
quit smoking. if you smoke, quit. smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. read more about smoking and your heart.
                
weight control. if youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. controlling your weight helps you control risk factors foratherosclerosis.
                
other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. if you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor.
                
if lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. take all of your medicines as your doctor advises."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with adult all.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all). some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    the treatment of adult all usually has two phases.
                    the treatment of adult all is done in phases:         -  remission induction therapy: this is the first phase of treatment. the goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. this puts the leukemia into remission.    -  post-remission therapy: this is the second phase of treatment. it begins once the leukemia is in remission. the goal of post-remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse. this phase is also called remission continuation therapy.        treatment called central nervous system (cns) sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy. because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the cns (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to ""find sanctuary"" (hide) in the cns. systemic chemotherapy given in high doses, intrathecal chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the cns. they are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur (come back). cns sanctuary therapy is also called cns prophylaxis.
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used:
                    chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult all that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. when used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord, it is called central nervous system (cns) sanctuary therapy or cns prophylaxis.        see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information.       radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer. external radiation therapy may be used to treat adult all that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. when used this way, it is called central nervous system (cns) sanctuary therapy or cns prophylaxis. external radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information.        targeted therapy      targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.    targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat some types of adult all. these drugs block the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells (blasts) than the body needs. three of the drugs used are imatinib mesylate (gleevec), dasatinib, and nilotinib.    see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    patients with all may have late effects after treatment.
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of treatment for all may include the risk of second cancers (new types of cancer). regular follow-up exams are very important for long-term survivors.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what causes congenital contractural arachnodactyly ?,"what causes congenital contractural arachnodactyly? congenital contractural arachnodactyly is caused by mutations in the fbn2 gene. the fbn2 gene provides instructions for producing the fibrillin-2 protein. fibrillin-2 binds to other proteins and molecules to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue. additionally, microfibrils hold molecules called growth factors and release them at the appropriate time to control the growth and repair of tissues and organs throughout the body. a mutation in the fbn2 gene can reduce the amount and/or quality of fibrillin-2 that is available to form microfibrils. as a result, decreased microfibril formation weakens the elastic fibers and allows growth factors to be released inappropriately, causing tall stature, deformities of the fingers and toes, and other characteristic features of congenital contractural arachnodactyly."

what is (are) falls ?,"a fall can change your life. if you're elderly, it can lead to disability and a loss of independence. if your bones are fragile from osteoporosis, you could break a bone, often a hip. but aging alone doesn't make people fall. diabetes and heart disease affect balance. so do problems with circulation, thyroid or nervous systems. some medicines make people dizzy. eye problems or alcohol can be factors. any of these things can make a fall more likely. babies and young children are also at risk of falling - off of furniture and down stairs, for example.    falls and accidents seldom ""just happen."" taking care of your health by exercising and getting regular eye exams and physicals may help reduce your chance of falling. getting rid of tripping hazards in your home and wearing nonskid shoes may also help. to reduce the chances of breaking a bone if you do fall, make sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin d.     nih: national institute on aging"
what is (are) tibial muscular dystrophy ?,"tibial muscular dystrophy is a condition that affects the muscles at the front of the lower leg. the signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear after age 35. the first sign is usually weakness and wasting (atrophy) of a muscle in the lower leg called the tibialis anterior. this muscle helps control up-and-down movement of the foot. weakness in the tibialis anterior muscle makes it difficult or impossible to walk on the heels, but it usually does not interfere significantly with regular walking.  muscle weakness worsens very slowly in people with tibial muscular dystrophy. ten to 20 years after the onset of symptoms, weakness may develop in muscles that help extend the toes (long-toe extensors). weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the toes while walking, a condition known as foot drop. later in life, about one third of people with tibial muscular dystrophy experience mild to moderate difficulty with walking because of weakness in other leg muscles. however, most affected individuals remain able to walk throughout their lives.  a small percentage of people with tibial muscular dystrophy have a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms than those described above. starting in childhood, these individuals may have generalized muscle weakness, weakness and atrophy of the thigh muscles (quadriceps) or other muscles in the legs, and weakness affecting muscles in the arms."
what are the symptoms of majeed syndrome ?,"what are the signs and symptoms of majeed syndrome? majeed syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the bones and skin. there are two main features of majeed syndrome: chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (crmo), an inflammatory bone condition which causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling. these symptoms begin in infancy or early childhood and typically persist into adulthood, although there may be short periods of improvement. crmo can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints. congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is a blood disorder which involve a shortage of red blood cells. without enough of these cells, the blood cannot carry an adequate supply of oxygen to the body's tissues. the resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. complications of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia can range from mild to severe. most people with majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as sweet syndrome. the symptoms of sweet syndrome include fever and the development of painful bumps or blisters on the face, neck, back, and arms. the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for majeed syndrome. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of temperature regulation 90% abnormality of the metaphyses 90% arthralgia 90% bone pain 90% microcytic anemia 90% osteomyelitis 90% pustule 90% skin rash 90% weight loss 90% acne 50% arthritis 50% edema 50% hepatomegaly 50% hyperostosis 50% leukocytosis 50% migraine 50% myalgia 50% splenomegaly 50% abnormal blistering of the skin 7.5% abnormality of bone mineral density 7.5% flexion contracture 7.5% glomerulopathy 7.5% hematuria 7.5% inflammatory abnormality of the eye 7.5% malabsorption 7.5% proteinuria 7.5% pulmonary infiltrates 7.5% recurrent fractures 7.5% vasculitis 7.5% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."
what is (are) greenberg dysplasia ?,"greenberg dysplasia is a severe condition characterized by specific bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. this condition is fatal before birth.  the bones of affected individuals do not develop properly, causing a distinctive spotted appearance called moth-eaten bone, which is visible on x-ray images. in addition, the bones have abnormal calcium deposits (ectopic calcification). affected individuals have extremely short bones in the arms and legs and abnormally flat vertebrae (platyspondyly). other skeletal abnormalities may include short ribs and extra fingers (polydactyly). in addition, affected fetuses have extensive swelling of the body caused by fluid accumulation (hydrops fetalis). greenberg dysplasia is also called hydrops-ectopic calcification-moth-eaten skeletal dysplasia (hem), which reflects the condition's most common features."

how to diagnose what i need to know about hirschsprung disease ?,"hd is diagnosed based on symptoms and test results.
                
a doctor will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your childs bowel movements. hd is much less likely if parents can identify a time when their childs bowel habits were normal.
                
if hd is suspected, the doctor will do one or more tests.
                
x rays
                
an x ray is a black-and-white picture of the inside of the body. to make the large intestine show up better, the doctor may fill it with barium liquid. barium liquid is inserted into the large intestine through the anus.
                
if hd is the problem, the last segment of the large intestine will look narrower than normal. just before this narrow segment, the intestine will look bulged. the bulging is caused by blocked stool stretching the intestine.
                
manometry
                
during manometry, the doctor inflates a small balloon inside the rectum. normally, the rectal muscles will relax. if the muscles dont relax, hd may be the problem. this test is most often done in older children and adults.
                
biopsy
                
biopsy is the most accurate test for hd. the doctor removes a tiny piece of the large intestine and looks at it with a microscope. if nerve cells are missing, hd is the problem."
is fg syndrome inherited ?,"fg syndrome is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the genes likely associated with this disorder, including med12, are located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation usually must occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of a gene on the x chromosome, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."
how to diagnose childhood hodgkin lymphoma ?,"tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood hodgkin lymphoma. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. sometimes a pet scan and a ct scan are done at the same time. if there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.    -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   sedimentation rate : a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. the sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. a higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or esr.    -   lymph node biopsy : the removal of all or part of a lymph node. the lymph node may be removed during an image-guided ct scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. one of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lymph node.       -  incisional biopsy : the removal of part of a lymph node.      -  core biopsy : the removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.      -  fine-needle aspiration (fna) biopsy : the removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.          a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially reed-sternberg cells. reed-sternberg cells are common in classical hodgkin lymphoma. the following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  immunophenotyping : a laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. this test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system."
do you have information about newborn screening,"summary : your newborn infant has screening tests before leaving the hospital. there may be different tests depending on the state where you live. they include       - tests on a few drops of blood from pricking the baby's heel. the tests look for inherited disorders. all states test for at least 30 of these conditions.    - a hearing test that measures the baby's response to sound    - a skin test that measures the level of oxygen in the blood. this can tell if the baby has a congenital heart defect.       these tests look for serious medical conditions. if not treated, some of these conditions can cause lifelong health problems. others can cause early death. with early diagnosis, treatment can begin right away, before serious problems can occur or become permanent.    if a screening shows that your baby might have a condition, the health care provider or the state health department will call you. it is important to follow up quickly. further testing can verify whether your baby has the condition. if so, treatment should start right away.     nih: national institute of child health and human development"
what are the treatments for prevent diabetes problems: keep your nervous system healthy ?,"the treatment for nerve damage from diabetes is based on your symptoms. no treatment can reverse nerve damage; however, it can help you feel better. your doctor might suggest taking low doses of medicines that both treat other health problems and help the pain of neuropathy. some of these medicines include
                
- antidepressants  - anticonvulsants, or anti-seizure medicines
                
other treatment options include
                
- creams or patches on your skin for burning pain  - over-the-counter pain medicines  - acupuncture, a form of pain treatment that uses needles inserted into your body at certain pressure points  - physical therapy, which helps with muscle weakness and loss of balance  - relaxation exercises, such as yoga  - special shoes to fit softly around sore feet or feet that have changed shape
                
your doctor also can prescribe medicines to help with problems caused by nerve damage in other areas of your body, such as poor digestion, dizziness, sexual problems, and lack of bladder control.

what is (are) hepatitis b ?,"your liver is the largest organ inside your body. it helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. one type, hepatitis b, is caused by the hepatitis b virus (hbv). hepatitis b spreads by contact with an infected person's blood, semen, or other body fluid. an infected woman can give hepatitis b to her baby at birth.    if you get hbv, you may feel as if you have the flu. you may also have jaundice, a yellowing of skin and eyes, dark-colored urine, and pale bowel movements. some people have no symptoms at all. a blood test can tell if you have it. hbv usually gets better on its own after a few months. if it does not get better, it is called chronic hbv, which lasts a lifetime. chronic hbv can lead to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer.    there is a vaccine for hbv. it requires three shots. all babies should get the vaccine, but older children and adults can get it too. if you travel to countries where hepatitis b is common, you should get the vaccine.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what is (are) cat scratch disease ?,"cat scratch disease (csd) is an illness caused by the bacterium bartonella henselae. almost half of all cats carry the infection at some point. the infection does not make cats sick. however, the scratch or bite of an infected cat can cause symptoms in people, including        - swollen lymph nodes, especially around the head, neck, and upper limbs    - fever    -  headache    - fatigue    - poor appetite        for people with weak immune systems, csd may cause more serious problems. the best way to avoid csd is to avoid rough play with cats that could lead to scratches or bites. if you do get a scratch or bite, wash it well with soap and water. if the bite or scratch gets infected or if you have symptoms of csd, call your doctor.     centers for disease control and prevention"
what is (are) neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ?,"neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. the body normally balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. however, people with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus produce too much urine (polyuria), which causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). affected people need to urinate frequently, which can disrupt daily activities and sleep.  people with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. dehydration can lead to constipation and dry skin. if the disorder is not treated, more serious complications of dehydration can occur. these include confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma.  neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or familial. the acquired form is brought on by injuries, tumors, and other factors, and can occur at any time during life. the familial form is caused by genetic mutations; its signs and symptoms usually become apparent in childhood and worsen over time.  neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes mellitus, which is much more common. diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin or an insensitivity to this hormone. although neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus have some features in common, they are separate disorders with different causes."
is potocki-shaffer syndrome inherited ?,"potocki-shaffer syndrome follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means a deletion of genetic material from one copy of chromosome 11 is sufficient to cause the disorder. in some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from an affected parent. more commonly, the condition results from a deletion that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or in early fetal development. these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

what to do for renal tubular acidosis ?,"- renal tubular acidosis (rta) is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine, which causes a person's blood to remain too acidic.  - without proper treatment, chronic acidity of the blood leads to growth retardation, kidney stones, bone disease, chronic kidney disease, and possibly total kidney failure.  - if rta is suspected, additional information about the sodium, potassium, and chloride levels in the urine and the potassium level in the blood will help identify which type of rta a person has.  - in all cases, the first goal of therapy is to neutralize acid in the blood, but different treatments may be needed to address the different underlying causes of acidosis."
what is (are) diabetic neuropathies: the nerve damage of diabetes ?,"diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. people with diabetes can, over time, develop nerve damage throughout the body. some people with nerve damage have no symptoms. others may have symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbnessloss of feelingin the hands, arms, feet, and legs. nerve problems can occur in every organ system, including the digestive tract, heart, and sex organs.
                
about 60 to 70 percent of people with diabetes have some form of neuropathy. people with diabetes can develop nerve problems at any time, but risk rises with age and longer duration of diabetes. the highest rates of neuropathy are among people who have had diabetes for at least 25 years. diabetic neuropathies also appear to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose, also called blood sugar, as well as those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure and those who are overweight."
what are the genetic changes related to critical congenital heart disease ?,"in most cases, the cause of cchd is unknown. a variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition.  changes in single genes have been associated with cchd. studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in cchd. however, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all cchd.  cchd is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). however, the heart defects associated with cchd can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. some of these genetic conditions, such as down syndrome, turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. other conditions, including noonan syndrome and alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes.  environmental factors may also contribute to the development of cchd. potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria. although researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown."
how to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and addison's disease ?,"in its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. a health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms.
                
a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests. a health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause. imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause.
                
a lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital.
                
hormonal blood and urine tests
                
- acth stimulation test. the acth stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. in this test, the patient is given an intravenous (iv) injection of synthetic acth, and samples of blood, urine, or both are taken before and after the injection. the cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab. the normal response after an acth injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. people with addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels.  both low- and high-dose acth stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency. for example, if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred, the adrenal glands may still respond to acth because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone. some studies have suggested a low dose1 microgram (mcg)may be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people, yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency. however, recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the low-dose test, which may lead to unnecessary treatment. therefore, some health care providers favor using a 250 mcg acth test for more accurate results.   - crh stimulation test. when the response to the acth test is abnormal, a crh stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. in this test, the patient is given an iv injection of synthetic crh, and blood is taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. the cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab. people with addisons disease respond by producing high levels of acth, yet no cortisol. people with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce acth or have a delayed response. crh will not stimulate acth secretion if the pituitary is damaged, so no acth response points to the pituitary as the cause. a delayed acth response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.
                
diagnosis during adrenal crisis
                
although a reliable diagnosis is not possible during adrenal crisis, measurement of blood acth and cortisol during the crisisbefore treatment with corticosteroids is givenis often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis. low blood sodium, low blood glucose, and high blood potassium are also sometimes present at the time of adrenal crisis. once the crisis is controlled, an acth stimulation test can be performed to help make a specific diagnosis. more complex lab tests are sometimes used if the diagnosis remains unclear."

what is (are) colonic polyps ?,"a polyp is an extra piece of tissue that grows inside your body. colonic polyps grow in the large intestine, or colon. most polyps are not dangerous. however, some polyps may turn into cancer or already be cancer. to be safe, doctors remove polyps and test them. polyps can be removed when a doctor examines the inside of the large intestine during a colonoscopy.    anyone can get polyps, but certain people are more likely than others. you may have a greater chance of getting polyps if you        -  are over age 50     -  have had polyps before     -  have a family member with polyps     -  have a family history of colon cancer        most colon polyps do not cause symptoms. if you have symptoms, they may include blood on your underwear or on toilet paper after a bowel movement, blood in your stool, or constipation or diarrhea lasting more than a week.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what is (are) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ?,"thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp) is a rare blood disorder. in ttp, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body.
                
the clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. as a result, serious health problems can develop.
                
the increased clotting that occurs in ttp also uses up platelets (plate-lets) in the blood. platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. these cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.
                
with fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. people who have ttp may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. when cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.
                
""thrombotic"" (throm-bot-ik) refers to the blood clots that form. ""thrombocytopenic"" (throm-bo-cy-toe-pee-nick) means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. ""purpura"" (purr-purr-ah) refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin.
                
bleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. these pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-tee-kee-ay). petechiae may look like a rash.
                
purpura and petechiae
                

                
ttp also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. this leads to hemolytic anemia (hee-moh-lit-ick uh-nee-me-uh)a rare form of anemia. anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.
                
a lack of activity in the adamts13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes ttp. the adamts13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting. the enzyme breaks up a large protein called von willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots.
                
types of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
                
the two main types of ttp are inherited and acquired. ""inherited"" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. this type of ttp mainly affects newborns and children.
                
in inherited ttp, the adamts13 gene is faulty and doesn't prompt the body to make a normal adamts13 enzyme. as a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.
                
acquired ttp is the more common type of the disorder. ""acquired"" means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it. this type of ttp mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children.
                
in acquired ttp, the adamts13 gene isn't faulty. instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the adamts13 enzyme.
                
it's not clear what triggers inherited and acquired ttp, but some factors may play a role. these factors may include:
                
some diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, hiv, lupus, and infections
                
some medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
some medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine a, and hormone therapy and estrogens
                
quinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products
                
if you have ttp, you may sometimes hear it referred to as ttphus. hus, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is a disorder that resembles ttp, but is more common in children. kidney problems also tend to be worse in hus. although some researchers think ttp and hus are two forms of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that each has different causes.
                
outlook
                
ttp is a rare disorder. it can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it's not treated right away.
                
ttp usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can continue for months. relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of ttp. many people who have inherited ttp have frequent flareups that need to be treated.
                
treatments for ttp include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis (plaz-ma-feh-re-sis). these treatments have greatly improved the outlook of the disorder."

what are the symptoms of prevent diabetes problems: keep your heart and blood vessels healthy ?,"a stroke happens when part of your brain is not getting enough blood and stops working. depending on the part of the brain that is damaged, a stroke can cause
                
- sudden weakness or numbness of your face, arm, or leg on one side of your body  - sudden confusion, trouble talking, or trouble understanding  - sudden dizziness, loss of balance, or trouble walking  - sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes or sudden double vision  - sudden severe headache
                
sometimes, one or more of these warning signs may happen and then disappear. you might be having a ""mini-stroke,"" also called a tia or a transient ischemic attack. if you have any of these warning signs, call 911 right away. getting care for a tia may reduce or prevent a stroke. getting prompt treatment for a stroke can reduce the damage to the brain and improve chances for recovery."
what is (are) aneurysm ?,"an aneurysm (an-u-rism) is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your body.
                
arteries have thick walls to withstand normal blood pressure. however, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or injure artery walls. the force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm.
                
an aneurysm can grow large and rupture (burst) or dissect. a rupture causes dangerous bleeding inside the body. a dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. the split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall.
                
both rupture and dissection often are fatal.
                
overview
                
most aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. the aorta goes through the chest and abdomen.
                
an aneurysm that occurs in the chest portion of the aorta is called a thoracic (tho-ras-ik) aortic aneurysm. an aneurysm that occurs in the abdominal portion of the aorta is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
                
aneurysms also can occur in other arteries, but these types of aneurysm are less common. this article focuses on aortic aneurysms.
                
about 13,000 americans die each year from aortic aneurysms. most of the deaths result from rupture or dissection.
                
early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection. however, aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms. thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms can benefit from early, routine screening.
                
outlook
                
doctors often can successfully treat aortic aneurysms with medicines or surgery if theyre found in time. medicines may be given to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and reduce the risk of rupture.
                
large aortic aneurysms often can be repaired with surgery. during surgery, the weak or damaged portion of the aorta is replaced or reinforced."
what are the genetic changes related to von hippel-lindau syndrome ?,"mutations in the vhl gene cause von hippel-lindau syndrome. the vhl gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. mutations in this gene prevent production of the vhl protein or lead to the production of an abnormal version of the protein. an altered or missing vhl protein cannot effectively regulate cell survival and division. as a result, cells grow and divide uncontrollably to form the tumors and cysts that are characteristic of von hippel-lindau syndrome."
"what is (are) blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2 ?","blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2 (bpes ii) is a condition that mainly affects the development of the eyelids. people with this condition have a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). in addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). because of these eyelid malformations, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited. bpes type 2 consists only of the eyelid malformations, whereas  bpes type 1 also causes premature ovarian failure. it is caused by mutations in the foxl2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. treatment typically consists of various eyelid surgeries to correct the malformations."
what is (are) familial porencephaly ?,"familial porencephaly is part of a group of conditions called the col4a1-related disorders. the conditions in this group have a range of signs and symptoms that involve fragile blood vessels. in familial porencephaly, fluid-filled cysts develop in the brain (porencephaly) during fetal development or soon after birth. these cysts typically occur in only one side of the brain and vary in size. the cysts are thought to be the result of bleeding within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). people with this condition also have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (mri).  during infancy, people with familial porencephaly typically have paralysis affecting one side of the body (infantile hemiplegia). affected individuals may also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), migraine headaches, speech problems, intellectual disability, and uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia). some people are severely affected, and others may have no symptoms related to the brain cysts."
how to prevent iga nephropathy ?,"researchers have not found a way to prevent iga nephropathy. people with a family history of iga nephropathy should talk with their health care provider to find out what steps they can take to keep their kidneys healthy, such as controlling their blood pressure and keeping their blood cholesterol at healthy levels."
what is (are) diverticular disease ?,"when a person has diverticula that do not cause diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding, the condition is called diverticulosis. most people with diverticulosis do not have symptoms. some people with diverticulosis have constipation or diarrhea. people may also have chronic
                
- cramping or pain in the lower abdomenthe area between the chest and hips  - bloating
                
other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and stomach ulcers, cause similar problems, so these symptoms do not always mean a person has diverticulosis. people with these symptoms should see their health care provider."
what is (are) familial pityriasis rubra pilaris ?,"familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. the name of the condition reflects its major features: the term ""pityriasis"" refers to scaling; ""rubra"" means redness; and ""pilaris"" suggests the involvement of hair follicles in this disorder. affected individuals have a salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. this rash occurs in patches all over the body, with distinct areas of unaffected skin between the patches. affected individuals also develop bumps called follicular keratoses that occur around hair follicles. the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet often becomes thick, hard, and callused, a condition known as palmoplantar keratoderma.  researchers have distinguished six types of pityriasis rubra pilaris based on the features of the disorder and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. the familial form is usually considered part of type v, which is also known as the atypical juvenile type. people with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris typically have skin abnormalities from birth or early childhood, and these skin problems persist throughout life."
what are the genetic changes related to spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 ?,"mutations in the ighmbp2 gene cause smard1. the ighmbp2 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in copying (replicating) dna; producing rna, a chemical cousin of dna; and producing proteins. ighmbp2 gene mutations that cause smard1 lead to the production of a protein with reduced ability to aid in dna replication and the production of rna and proteins. these problems particularly affect alpha-motor neurons, which are specialized cells in the brainstem and spinal cord that control muscle movements. although the mechanism is unknown, altered ighmbp2 proteins contribute to the damage of these neurons and their death over time. the cumulative death of alpha-motor neurons leads to breathing problems and progressive muscle weakness in children with smard1.  research suggests that the amount of functional protein that is produced from the mutated ighmbp2 gene may play a role in the severity of smard1. individuals who have some functional protein are more likely to develop signs and symptoms later in childhood and retain a greater level of muscle function."

what is (are) klippel-trenaunay syndrome ?,"klippel-trenaunay syndrome is a condition that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones. the disorder has three characteristic features: a red birthmark called a port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations.  most people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome are born with a port-wine stain. this type of birthmark is caused by swelling of small blood vessels near the surface of the skin. port-wine stains are typically flat and can vary from pale pink to deep maroon in color. in people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome, the port-wine stain usually covers part of one limb. the affected area may become lighter or darker with age. occasionally, port-wine stains develop small red blisters that break open and bleed easily.  klippel-trenaunay syndrome is also associated with overgrowth of bones and soft tissues beginning in infancy. usually this abnormal growth is limited to one limb, most often one leg. however, overgrowth can also affect the arms or, rarely, the trunk. the abnormal growth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and reduced movement in the affected area. if the overgrowth causes one leg to be longer than the other, it can also lead to problems with walking.  malformations of veins are the third major feature of klippel-trenaunay syndrome. these abnormalities include varicose veins, which are swollen and twisted veins near the surface of the skin that often cause pain. varicose veins usually occur on the sides of the upper legs and calves. veins deep in the limbs can also be abnormal in people with klippel-trenaunay syndrome. malformations of deep veins increase the risk of a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (dvt). if a dvt travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism (pe).  complications of klippel-trenaunay syndrome can include a type of skin infection called cellulitis, swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and internal bleeding from abnormal blood vessels. less commonly, this condition is also associated with fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly) or the presence of extra digits (polydactyly)."
what is (are) bod syndrome ?,"bod syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by underdeveloped pinky toenails or fingernails, normal intellect to mild intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and short stature. the cause of the condition is not known. bod syndrome is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, however in many cases the condition occurs for the first time in a family due to a new mutation. signs and symptoms of bod syndrome are similar to, albeit milder than that of, coffin-siris syndrome. the relationship between these syndromes is presently unknown."
what is (are) anemia ?,"if you have anemia, your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. the most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. it carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.    anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction.    conditions that may lead to anemia include       - heavy periods    - pregnancy    - ulcers    - colon polyps or colon cancer    - inherited disorders    - a diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin b12    - blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, or cancer    - aplastic anemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired    - g6pd deficiency, a metabolic disorder       anemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable. you may be short of breath or have a headache.    your doctor will diagnose anemia with a physical exam and blood tests. treatment depends on the kind of anemia you have.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"
"what is (are) usher syndrome, type 2c ?","usher syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by hearing loss or deafness, and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. three major types of usher syndrome have been described - types i, ii, and iii.  the different types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. all three types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell have mutations."
what are the treatments for insomnia ?,"lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. these changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
                
a type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.
                
several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. however, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).
                
lifestyle changes
                
if you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:
                
caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. the effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.
                
certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.
                
alcohol. an alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. however, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. this makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.
                
try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. for example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.
                
try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.
                
make your bedroom sleep-friendly. avoid bright lighting while winding down. try to limit possible distractions, such as a tv, computer, or pet. make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.
                
go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. if you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.
                
cognitive-behavioral therapy
                
cbt for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. this therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.
                
for example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. these strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.
                
cbt also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. this method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.
                
cbt also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. this method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. the goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.
                
cbt also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. this method involves setting a sleep schedule. at first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.
                
this schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. however, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.
                
for success with cbt, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. cbt works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. it also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.
                
for people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, cbt combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.
                
medicines
                
prescription medicines
                
many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.
                
talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. for example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.
                
rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. if you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. he or she might prescribe a different medicine.
                
some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.
                
over-the-counter products
                
some over-the-counter (otc) products claim to treat insomnia. these products include melatonin, l-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.
                
the food and drug administration doesn't regulate natural products and some food supplements. thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. how well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.
                
some otc products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.
                
antihistamines pose risks for some people. also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you."
what is (are) lyme disease ?,"lyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick. the first symptom is usually a rash, which may look like a bull's eye. as the infection spreads, you may have       - a fever    - a headache    - muscle and joint aches    - a stiff neck    - fatigue       lyme disease can be hard to diagnose because you may not have noticed a tick bite. also, many of its symptoms are like those of the flu and other diseases. in the early stages, your health care provider will look at your symptoms and medical history, to figure out whether you have lyme disease. lab tests may help at this stage, but may not always give a clear answer. in the later stages of the disease, a different lab test can confirm whether you have it.    antibiotics can cure most cases of lyme disease. the sooner treatment begins, the quicker and more complete the recovery.    after treatment, some patients may still have muscle or joint aches and nervous system symptoms. this is called post-lyme disease syndrome (plds). long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help with plds. however, there are ways to help with the symptoms of plds, and most patients do get better with time.    nih: national institute of allergy and infectious diseases"
what is (are) castleman disease ?,"castleman disease (cd) is a rare condition that affects the lymph nodes and related tissues. there are two main forms: unicentric cd and multicentric cd. unicentric cd is a ""localized"" condition that is generally confined to a single set of lymph nodes, while multicentric cd is a ""systemic"" disease that affects multiple sets of lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body. the exact underlying cause of cd is currently unknown; however, it is thought to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. treatment varies based on the form of the condition, the severity of symptoms and whether or not the affected person also has an hiv and/or human herpes virus type 8 (hhv-8) infection. for more specific information about each form of cd, please visit gard's unicentric castleman disease and multicentric castleman disease pages."
what are the symptoms of prostate cancer ?,"symptoms most cancers in their early, most treatable stages don't cause any symptoms. early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. however, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night  - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine  - inability to urinate  - weak or interrupted flow of urine  - painful or burning urination  - difficulty in having an erection  - painful ejaculation  - blood in urine or semen  - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. if you have symptoms if you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. a urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. the doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. the psa test the doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or psa, level. psa levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. psa tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. however, psa tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. psa screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) most men with mildly elevated psa do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of psa. a recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or psa, may still have prostate cancer. also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. other tests the doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, mri, or ct scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. but to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. during a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. if cancer is present if a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. one way of grading prostate cancer, called the gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. another system uses g1 through g4. the higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. high-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors."
what is (are) childbirth problems ?,"while childbirth usually goes well, complications can happen. they can cause a risk to the mother, baby, or both. possible complications include       - preterm (premature) labor, when labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy    - problems with the umbilical cord    - problems with the position of the baby, such as breech, in which the baby is going to come out feet first    - birth injuries       for some of these problems, the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a cesarean section."
how many people are affected by frasier syndrome ?,frasier syndrome is thought to be a rare condition; approximately 50 cases have been described in the scientific literature.
is chorea-acanthocytosis inherited ?,"how do people inherit chorea-acanthocytosis? chorea-acanthocytosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to osteoglophonic dysplasia ?,"osteoglophonic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the fgfr1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. this protein is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors, which are related proteins that bind (attach) to other proteins called fibroblast growth factors. the growth factors and their receptors are involved in important processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryonic development. in particular, they play a major role in skeletal development.  the fgfr1 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. when a fibroblast growth factor binds to the part of the fgfr1 protein outside the cell, the receptor triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. the fgfr1 protein is thought to play an important role in the development of the nervous system. this protein may also help regulate the growth of long bones, such as the large bones in the arms and legs.  fgfr1 gene mutations that cause osteoglophonic dysplasia change single building blocks (amino acids) in the fgfr1 protein. the altered fgfr1 protein appears to cause prolonged signaling, which promotes premature fusion of bones in the skull and disrupts the regulation of bone growth in the arms and legs."
what are the treatments for pleurisy and other pleural disorders ?,"pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. the goals of treatment include:
                
relieving symptoms
                
removing the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space (if a large amount is present)
                
treating the underlying condition
                
relieving symptoms
                
to relieve pleurisy symptoms, your doctor may recommend:
                
acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) to control pain.
                
codeine-based cough syrups to controlcoughing.
                
lying on your painful side. this might make you more comfortable.
                
breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. otherwise, you may developpneumonia.
                
getting plenty of rest.
                
removing fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space
                
your doctor may recommend removing fluid, air, or blood from your pleural space to prevent a lung collapse.
                
the procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are similar.
                
duringthoracentesis, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space. an attached syringe will draw fluid out of your chest. this procedure can remove more than 6 cups of fluid at a time.
                
if your doctor needs to remove a lot of fluid, he or she may use a chest tube. your doctor will inject a painkiller into the area of your chest wall where the fluid is. he or she will then insert a plastic tube into your chest between two ribs. the tube will be connected to a box that suctions out the fluid. your doctor will use achest x ray to check the tube's position.
                
your doctor also can use a chest tube to drain blood and air from the pleural space. this process can take several days. the tube will be left in place, and you'll likely stay in the hospital during this time.
                
sometimes the fluid in the pleural space contains thick pus or blood clots. it may form a hard skin or peel, which makes the fluid harder to drain. to help break up the pus or blood clots, your doctor may use a chest tube to deliver medicines called fibrinolytics to the pleural space. if the fluid still won't drain, you may need surgery.
                
if you have a small, persistent air leak into the pleural space, your doctor may attach a one-way valve to the chest tube. the valve allows air to exit the pleural space, but not reenter. using this type of valve may allow you to continue your treatment from home.
                
treat the underlying condition
                
the fluid sample that was removed during thoracentesis will be checked under a microscope. this can tell your doctor what's causing the fluid buildup, and he or she can decide the best way to treat it.
                
if the fluid is infected, treatment will involve antibiotics and drainage. if you have tuberculosis or a fungal infection, treatment will involve long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines.
                
if tumors in the pleura are causing fluid buildup, the fluid may quickly build up again after it's drained. sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. if they don't, your doctor may seal the pleural space. sealing the pleural space is called pleurodesis (plur-od-eh-sis).
                
for this procedure, your doctor will drain all of the fluid out of your chest through a chest tube. then he or she will push a substance through the chest tube into the pleural space. the substance will irritate the surface of the pleura. this will cause the two layers of the pleura to stick together, preventing more fluid from building up.
                
chemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors.
                
ifheart failureis causing fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics (medicines that help reduce fluid buildup) and other medicines."
what is (are) fragile x syndrome ?,"fragile x syndrome is the most common form of inherited developmental disability. a problem with a specific gene causes the disease. normally, the gene makes a protein you need for brain development. but the problem causes a person to make little or none of the protein. this causes the symptoms of fragile x.     people with only a small change in the gene might not show any signs of fragile x. people with bigger changes can have severe symptoms. these might include       - intelligence problems, ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual disabilities    - social and emotional problems, such as aggression in boys or shyness in girls    - speech and language problems, especially in boys       a genetic blood test can diagnose fragile x. there is no cure. you can treat some symptoms with educational, behavioral, or physical therapy, and with medicines. getting treatment early can help.    nih: national institute of child health and human development"

what is (are) hypotension ?,"hypotension (hi-po-ten-shun) is abnormally low blood pressure. blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.
                
blood pressure is measured as systolic (sis-tol-ik) and diastolic (di-a-stol-ik) pressures. ""systolic"" refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. ""diastolic"" refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.
                
you most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number, such as 120/80 mmhg. (the mmhg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)
                
normal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmhg. hypotension is blood pressure that's lower than 90/60 mmhg.
                
overview
                
blood pressure doesn't stay the same all the time. it lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up. blood pressure also rises when you're excited, nervous, or active.
                
your body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure. for example, if you stand up quickly, your blood pressure may drop for a short time. your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.
                
most forms of hypotension happen because your body can't bring blood pressure back to normal or can't do it fast enough.
                
some people have low blood pressure all the time. they have no signs or symptoms, and their low blood pressure is normal for them.
                
in other people, certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure. as a result, less blood and oxygen flow to the body's organs.
                
for the most part, hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition, such as heart disease. signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness, fainting, cold and sweaty skin, fatigue (tiredness), blurred vision, or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).
                
in extreme cases, hypotension can lead to shock.
                
outlook
                
in a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment. if it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that's causing it.
                
hypotension can be dangerous. it can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that's often fatal if not treated right away. with prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated."

what are the symptoms of alcohol use and older adults ?,"its not always obvious that someone drinks too much. for older adults, clues to a possible alcohol problem include memory loss, depression, anxiety, poor appetite, unexplained bruises, falls, sleeping problems, and inattention to cleanliness or appearance. answering ""yes"" to at least one of the following questions is also a sign of a possible drinking problem: - have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?  - have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?  - have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?  - have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover? have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking? have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover? if you answered yes to any of these questions, talk with your health care provider. also seek help if you feel you are having drinking-related problems with your health, relationships, or work."
is ataxia-telangiectasia inherited ?,"ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the atm gene in each cell have mutations. most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  about 1 percent of the united states population carries one mutated copy and one normal copy of the atm gene in each cell. these individuals are called carriers. although atm mutation carriers do not have ataxia-telangiectasia, they are more likely than people without an atm mutation to develop cancer; female carriers are particularly at risk for developing breast cancer. carriers of a mutation in the atm gene also may have an increased risk of heart disease."
what is (are) bell's palsy ?,"bell's palsy is a form of temporary facial paralysis which results from damage or trauma to one of the facial nerves. this disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that often affects just one side and can cause significant facial distortion. symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. while the exact cause is unknown, many researchers believe that a virus may lead to swelling of the 7th cranial nerve. steroids, such as prednisone, may reduce the inflammation and swelling. other medications used to treat bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain). physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used."
what is (are) chickenpox ?,"chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. most cases are in children under age 15, but older children and adults can get it. it spreads very easily from one person to another.    the classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable, itchy rash. the rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. it usually shows up on the face, chest, and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. other symptoms include       - fever    - headache    - tiredness    - loss of appetite       chickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. acetaminophen can treat the fever. do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause reye syndrome.    chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. adults, babies, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. they may need to take antiviral medicines.    once you catch chickenpox, the virus usually stays in your body. you probably will not get chickenpox again, but the virus can cause shingles in adults. a chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox, or make it less severe if you do get it.    centers for disease control and prevention"
what is (are) autosomal dominant hyper-ige syndrome ?,"autosomal dominant hyper-ige syndrome (ad-hies), also known as job syndrome, is a condition that affects several body systems, particularly the immune system. recurrent infections are common in people with this condition. affected individuals tend to have frequent bouts of pneumonia, which are caused by certain kinds of bacteria that infect the lungs and cause inflammation. these infections often result in the formation of air-filled cysts (pneumatoceles) in the lungs. recurrent skin infections and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema are also very common in ad-hies. these skin problems cause rashes, blisters, accumulations of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling.  ad-hies is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin e (ige) in the blood. ige normally triggers an immune response against foreign invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and plays a role in allergies. it is unclear why people with ad-hies have such high levels of ige.  ad-hies also affects other parts of the body, including the bones and teeth. many people with ad-hies have skeletal abnormalities such as an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced bone density (osteopenia), and a tendency for bones to fracture easily. dental abnormalities are also common in this condition. the primary (baby) teeth do not fall out at the usual time during childhood but are retained as the adult teeth grow in. other signs and symptoms of ad-hies can include abnormalities of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries), distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities of the brain, which do not affect a person's intelligence."
what is (are) osteogenesis imperfecta type vi ?,"osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 is a form of osteogenesis imperfecta which results in weakened bones that breaks easily.  when viewed under a microscope, bone tissue has a distinct ""fish-scale"" pattern.  individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 appear to be healthy at birth and do not have fractures until after 6 months of age. osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 may be caused by mutations in the serpinf1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

who is at risk for varicose veins? ?,"many factors may raise your risk for varicose veins, including family history, older age, gender, pregnancy, overweight or obesity, lack of movement, and leg trauma.
                
family history
                
having family members who have varicose veins may raise your risk for the condition. about half of all people who have varicose veins have a family history of them.
                
older age
                
getting older may raise your risk for varicose veins. the normal wear and tear of aging may cause the valves in your veins to weaken and not work well.
                
gender
                
women tend to get varicose veins more often than men. hormonal changes that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause (or with the use of birth control pills) may raise a woman's risk for varicose veins.
                
pregnancy
                
during pregnancy, the growing fetus puts pressure on the veins in the mother's legs. varicose veins that occur during pregnancy usually get better within 3 to 12 months of delivery.
                
overweight or obesity
                
being overweight or obese can put extra pressure on your veins. this can lead to varicose veins. for more information about overweight and obesity, go to the health topics overweight and obesity article.
                
lack of movement
                
standing or sitting for a long time, especially with your legs bent or crossed, may raise your risk for varicose veins. this is because staying in one position for a long time may force your veins to work harder to pump blood to your heart.
                
leg trauma
                
previous blood clots or traumatic damage to the valves in your veins can weaken their ability to move blood back to the heart, increasing the risk for varicose veins."

what is (are) mucolipidosis type iv ?,"mucolipidosis type iv is an inherited disorder characterized by delayed development and vision impairment that worsens over time. the severe form of the disorder is called typical mucolipidosis type iv, and the mild form is called atypical mucolipidosis type iv.  approximately 95 percent of individuals with this condition have the severe form. people with typical mucolipidosis type iv have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay). motor skills include sitting, standing, walking, grasping objects, and writing. psychomotor delay is moderate to severe and usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. affected individuals have intellectual disability, limited or absent speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that gradually turns into abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), and problems controlling hand movements. most people with typical mucolipidosis type iv are unable to walk independently. in about 15 percent of affected individuals, the psychomotor problems worsen over time.  vision may be normal at birth in people with typical mucolipidosis type iv, but it becomes increasingly impaired during the first decade of life. individuals with this condition develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea) and progressive breakdown of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retina). by their early teens, affected individuals have severe vision loss or blindness.  people with typical mucolipidosis type iv also have impaired production of stomach acid (achlorhydria). achlorhydria does not cause any symptoms in these individuals, but it does result in unusually high levels of gastrin in the blood. gastrin is a hormone that regulates the production of stomach acid. individuals with mucolipidosis type iv may not have enough iron in their blood, which can lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). people with the severe form of this disorder usually survive to adulthood; however, they may have a shortened lifespan.  about 5 percent of affected individuals have atypical mucolipidosis type iv. these individuals usually have mild psychomotor delay and may develop the ability to walk. people with atypical mucolipidosis type iv tend to have milder eye abnormalities than those with the severe form of the disorder. achlorhydria also may be present in mildly affected individuals."
what causes cadasil ?,"what causes cadasil? cadasil is caused by a mutation in the notch3 gene. the notch3 gene gives the body instructions to make the notch3 receptor protein, needed for normal function and survival of vascular smooth muscle cells. mutations in notch3 cause the body to make an abnormal protein, thus impairing the function and survival of vascular smooth muscle cells and causing these cells to self-destruct. the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells in the brain causes blood vessel damage that leads to the characteristic features of cadasil."

what are the genetic changes related to lattice corneal dystrophy type i ?,"lattice corneal dystrophy type i is caused by mutations in the tgfbi gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many tissues throughout the body, including the cornea. the tgfbi protein is part of the extracellular matrix, an intricate network that forms in the spaces between cells and provides structural support to tissues. the protein is thought to play a role in the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion) and cell movement (migration).  the tgfbi gene mutations involved in lattice corneal dystrophy type i change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the tgfbi protein. mutated tgfbi proteins abnormally clump together and form amyloid deposits. however, it is unclear how the changes caused by the gene mutations induce the protein to form deposits."
what are the treatments for childhood nephrotic syndrome ?,"health care providers will decide how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome based on the type:
                
- primary childhood nephrotic syndrome: medications  - secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome: treat the underlying illness or disease  - congenital nephrotic syndrome: medications, surgery to remove one or both kidneys, and transplantation
                
primary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
health care providers treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome with several types of medications that control the immune system, remove extra fluid, and lower blood pressure.
                
- control the immune system. corticosteroids are a group of medications that reduce the activity of the immune system, decrease the amount of albumin lost in the urine, and decrease swelling. health care providers commonly use prednisone or a related corticosteroid to treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome. about 90 percent of children achieve remission with daily corticosteroids for 6 weeks and then a slightly smaller dose every other day for 6 weeks.2 remission is a period when the child is symptom-free.  many children relapse after initial therapy, and health care providers treat them with a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. children may have multiple relapses; however, they most often recover without long-term kidney damage.  when a child has frequent relapses or does not respond to treatment, a health care provider may prescribe other medications that reduce the activity of the immune system. these medications prevent the body from making antibodies that can damage kidney tissues. they include      - cyclophosphamide    - mycophenolate (cellcept, myfortic)    - cyclosporine    - tacrolimus (hecoria, prograf)   a health care provider may use these other immune system medications with corticosteroids or in place of corticosteroids.  - remove extra fluid. a health care provider may prescribe a diuretic, a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. removing the extra fluid can often help to lower blood pressure.  - lower blood pressure. some children with childhood nephrotic syndrome develop high blood pressure and may need to take additional medications to lower their blood pressure. two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have the additional benefit of slowing the progression of kidney disease. many children with nephrotic syndrome require two or more medications to control their blood pressure.
                
secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
health care providers treat secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the primary illness. for example, a health care provider may treat children by
                
- prescribing antibiotics for an infection  - adjusting medications to treat lupus, hiv, or diabetes  - changing or stopping medications that are known to cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
while treating the underlying cause, the health care provider will also treat the child to improve or restore kidney function with the same medications used to treat primary childhood nephrotic syndrome.
                
caretakers should make sure that children take all prescribed medications and follow the treatment plan recommended by their health care provider.
                
more information about specific treatments for secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is provided in the niddk health topic, glomerular diseases.
                
congenital nephrotic syndrome
                
researchers have found that medications are not effective in treating congenital nephrotic syndrome, and that most children will need a kidney transplant by the time they are 2 or 3 years old. a kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor, most often a family member, into a persons body to take over the job of the failing kidney. to keep the child healthy until the transplant, the health care provider may recommend the following:
                
- albumin injections to make up for the albumin lost in urine  - diuretics to help remove extra fluid that causes swelling  - antibiotics to treat the first signs of infection  - growth hormones to promote growth and help bones mature  - removal of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine  - dialysis to artificially filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail

what causes kyrle disease ?,"what causes kyrle disease? the cause of kyrle disease is currently unknown. some cases appear to be idiopathic (no known triggers), or inherited. what has been found is that kyrle disease appears to occur more frequently in patients with certain systemic disorders, which include diabetes mellitus; renal disease (chronic renal failure, albuminuria, elevated serum creatinine, abnormal creatinine clearance, polyuria); hepatic abnormalities (alcoholic cirrhosis); and congestive heart failure. it has been thought that metabolic disorders associated with kyrle disease are somehow responsible for development of abnormal keratinization and connective tissue changes, but the exact mechanism by which this happens is unclear."
what is (are) pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a condition that involves seizures beginning in infancy or, in some cases, before birth. those affected typically experience prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus). these seizures involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizures). additional features of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy include low body temperature (hypothermia), poor muscle tone (dystonia) soon after birth, and irritability before a seizure episode. in rare instances, children with this condition do not have seizures until they are 1 to 3 years old.  anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin b6 found in food). if left untreated, people with this condition can develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). even though seizures can be controlled with pyridoxine, neurological problems such as developmental delay and learning disorders may still occur."
what is (are) hip injuries and disorders ?,"your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis bone. hips are called ball-and-socket joints because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in your pelvis. your hips are very stable. when they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. however, playing sports, running, overuse or falling can all sometimes lead to hip injuries. these include        -  strains    -  bursitis    -  dislocations    -  fractures       certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. osteoarthritis can cause pain and limited motion. osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. both of these are common in older people.     treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement."
what is (are) metachromatic leukodystrophy ?,"metachromatic leukodystrophy (mld) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies, which are characterized by the toxic buildup of lipids (fatty materials such as oils and waxes) and other storage materials in cells in the white matter of the central nervous system and peripheral nerves. the buildup of storage materials impairs the growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers. (myelin, which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of a mixture of fats and proteins.) mld is one of several lipid storage diseases, which result in the harmful buildup of lipids in brain cells and other cells and tissues in the body. people with lipid storage diseases either do not produce enough of one of the enzymes needed to break down (metabolize) lipids or they produce enzymes that do not work properly. some leukodystrophies are caused by genetic defects of enzymes that regulate the metabolism of fats needed in myelin synthesis. mld, which affects males and females, is cause by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase a. mld has three characteristic forms: late infantile, juvenile, and adult. late infantile mld typically begins between 12 and 20 months following birth. infants appear normal at first but develop difficulty walking after the first year of life and eventually lose the ability to walk. other symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness,developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, impaired swallowing, and dementia before age 2. most children with this form of mld die by age 5. symptoms of the juvenile form of mld (which begins between 3-10 years of age) include impaired school performance, mental deterioration, an inability to control movements, seizures, and dementia. symptoms continue to get worse, and death eventually occurs 10 to 20 years following disease onset.. the adult form commonly begins after age 16, with symptoms that include psychiatric disturbances, seizures, tremor, impaired concentration, depression, and dementia. death generally occurs within 6 to 14 years after onset of symptoms."
what is (are) gardner syndrome ?,"gardner syndrome is a form of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) that is characterized by multiple colorectal polyps and various types of tumors, both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous). people affected by gardner syndrome have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer at an early age. they are also at an increased risk of developing other fap-related cancers, such as those of the small bowel, stomach, pancreas, thyroid, central nervous system, liver, bile ducts, and/or adrenal gland. other signs and symptoms of gardner syndrome include dental abnormalities; osteomas (benign bone growths); various skin abnormalities such as epidermoid cysts, fibromas (a benign tumor of the connective tissue), and lipomas; and desmoid tumors. it is caused by changes (mutations) in the apc gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. although there is no cure for gardner syndrome, management options are available to reduce the risk of cancer. these may include high risk screening, prophylactic surgeries and/or certain types of medications."
what causes diabetic retinopathy ?,"blood vessels damaged from diabetic retinopathy can cause vision loss in two ways. fragile, abnormal blood vessels can develop and leak blood into the center of the eye, blurring vision. this is proliferative retinopathy and is the fourth and most advanced stage of the disease. fluid can leak into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. the fluid makes the macula swell, blurring vision. this condition is called macular edema. it can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. about half of the people with proliferative retinopathy also have macular edema."
is spastic paraplegia type 15 inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) sleep disorders ?,"is it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night? do you wake up feeling tired or feel very sleepy during the day, even if you have had enough sleep? you might have a sleep disorder. the most common kinds are       - insomnia - a hard time falling or staying asleep    - sleep apnea - breathing interruptions during sleep    -  restless legs syndrome - a tingling or prickly sensation in the legs     - narcolepsy - daytime ""sleep attacks""       nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, sleep talking, head banging, wetting the bed and grinding your teeth are kinds of sleep problems called parasomnias. there are treatments for most sleep disorders. sometimes just having regular sleep habits can help."
what are the genetic changes related to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ?,"the hereditary form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be caused by mutations in at least two genes. about 90 percent of all cases of hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus result from mutations in the avpr2 gene. most of the remaining 10 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the aqp2 gene. both of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that help determine how much water is excreted in urine.  the acquired form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can result from chronic kidney disease, certain medications (such as lithium), low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), or an obstruction of the urinary tract.  the kidneys filter the blood to remove waste and excess fluid, which are stored in the bladder as urine. the balance between fluid intake and urine excretion is controlled by a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (adh). adh directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water into the bloodstream. normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), increased levels of adh in the blood tell the kidneys to make less urine. when fluid intake is adequate, lower levels of adh tell the kidneys to make more urine.  mutations in the avpr2 or aqp2 genes prevent the kidneys from responding to signals from adh. chronic kidney disease, certain drugs, and other factors can also impair the kidneys' ability to respond to this hormone. as a result, the kidneys do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. these problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
what is (are) cleidocranial dysplasia ?,"cleidocranial dysplasia is a condition that primarily affects the development of the bones and teeth. characteristic features of this condition include underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles) and delayed closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels). individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may also have decreased bone density (osteopenia), osteoporosis, dental abnormalities, hearing loss, and recurrent sinus and ear infections. mutations in the runx2 gene cause most cases of cleidocranial dysplasia. this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. in some cases, a person inherits cleidocranial dysplasia from a parent who also has the condition. other cases result from new mutations (de novo mutations) in the runx2 gene.  dental problems are addressed with several procedures. ear and sinus infections may be treated with antibiotics and use of ear tubes. in some cases surgery is needed for the cranial defect."

what are the genetic changes related to leber hereditary optic neuropathy ?,"mutations in the mt-nd1, mt-nd4, mt-nd4l, or mt-nd6 gene can cause lhon. these genes are found in the dna of cellular structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. although most dna is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own dna, known as mitochondrial dna or mtdna.  the genes associated with lhon each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function. these proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen, fats, and simple sugars to energy. mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process. it remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of lhon.  a significant percentage of people with a mutation that causes lhon do not develop any features of the disorder. specifically, more than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related health problems. additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies have produced conflicting results. researchers are also investigating whether changes in additional genes contribute to the development of signs and symptoms."

what are the treatments for kidney disease ?,"dialysis is a treatment to filter wastes and water from your blood. there are two major forms of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. (watch the video to learn more about dialysis. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) in hemodialysis, blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body. hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week, but it can also be done at home. each session usually lasts between three and four hours. peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood. this kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity (the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach, intestines, and liver) to filter your blood. it works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining. this fluid is then drained away. a key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home, while you sleep.  get more information about dialysis."

how to diagnose childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors ?,"imaging studies and tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood cns germ cell tumors. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   neurological exam : a series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. the exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. this may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -  visual field exam: an exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). this test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). the eyes are tested one at a time. the eye not being tested is covered.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).     -   lumbar puncture : a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from the spinal column. this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. the sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. a higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap.    -   tumor marker tests : a procedure in which a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood and csf by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. these are called tumor markers. the following tumor markers are used to diagnose some cns germ cell tumors:               -  alpha-fetoprotein (afp).      -  beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg).              -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -  blood hormone studies: a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. the blood will be checked for the levels of hormones made by the pituitary gland and other glands.
                    a biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of cns germ cell tumor. if doctors think your child may have a cns germ cell tumor, a biopsy may be done. for brain tumors, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. sometimes, a needle guided by a computer is used to remove the tissue sample. a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. if cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. the piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.    sometimes the diagnosis can be made based on the results of imaging and tumor marker tests and a biopsy is not needed.     the following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
                    some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. the pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. these may include the following specialists:         -  pediatrician.    -  pediatric surgeon.    -  radiation oncologist.    -  pediatric hematologist.    -  pediatric radiologist.    -  pediatric nurse specialist.    -  geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor.    -  social worker.    -  rehabilitation specialist.
                
                
                    treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.
                    for information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our side effects page.   side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:         - physical problems.    - changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  second cancers (new types of cancer).        some late effects may be treated or controlled. it is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery     surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. a type of surgery called wide local excision is often done. a wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it, including the lymph nodes. a second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:            - where in the body the tumor started.      - the effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.     - the effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.     - how the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first.           in most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.     rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site. surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy. chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors.    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. radiation therapy may also be given. treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. these types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  conformal radiation therapy: conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-d) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. this allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.        -  intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt): imrt is a type of 3-dimensional (3-d) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       - volumetrical modulated arc therapy (vmat): vmat is type of 3-d radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. the radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. treatment with vmat is delivered faster than treatment with imrt.       -  stereotactic body radiation therapy: stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. by having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. this procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  proton beam radiation therapy: proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. a radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. this type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.                -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. it is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina, vulva, uterus, bladder, prostate, head, or neck. internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy.           the type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.     external radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).    chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. the type of anticancer drug, dose, and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.    see drugs approved for rhabdomyosarcoma for more information.
                            
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

					                    the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. the order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. see the treatment option overview section of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.      rhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck       - for tumors of the brain: treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.    - for tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. if the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some tissues around the eye may be needed.    - for tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull but not in or near the eye: treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.    - for tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.    - for tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including stereotactic body radiation therapy.    - for tumors of the larynx (voice box): treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.           rhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs       -  chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. if the tumor was not completely removed, a second surgery to remove the tumor may be done. radiation therapy may also be given.    - for tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. the tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.    -  lymph node dissection (one or more lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer).                - for tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.      - for tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the groin area are removed.                    rhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis       - for tumors in the chest or abdomen (including the chest wall or abdominal wall): surgery (wide local excision) may be done. if the tumor is large, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given to shrink the tumor before surgery.    - for tumors of the pelvis: surgery (wide local excision) may be done. if the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery. radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - for tumors of the diaphragm: a biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. surgery may be done later to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - for tumors of the gallbladder or bile ducts: a biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.    - for tumors of the muscles or tissues around the anus or between the vulva and the anus or the scrotum and the anus: surgery is done to remove as much of the tumor as possible and some nearby lymph nodes, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.           rhabdomyosarcoma of the kidney       - for tumors of the kidney: surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be given.           rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate       - for tumors that are only at the top of the bladder: surgery (wide local excision) is done.    - for tumors of the prostate or bladder (other than the top of the bladder):                -  chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given first to shrink the tumor. if cancer cells remain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery. surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or pelvic exenteration without removal of the rectum. (this may include removal of the lower colon and bladder. in girls, the cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes may be removed).      - chemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor. surgery to remove the tumor, but not the bladder or prostate, is done. internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.                    rhabdomyosarcoma of the area near the testicles       -  surgery to remove the testicle and spermatic cord. the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen may be checked for cancer, especially if the lymph nodes are large or the child is 10 years or older.     -  radiation therapy may be given if the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery.            rhabdomyosarcoma of the vulva, vagina, uterus, cervix, or ovary       - for tumors of the vulva and vagina: treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - for tumors of the uterus: treatment may include chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. sometimes surgery may be needed to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - for tumors of the cervix: treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.    - for tumors of the ovary: treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.          metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma     treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the tumor, is given to the site where the tumor first formed. if the cancer has spread to the brain, spinal cord, or lungs, radiation therapy may also be given to the sites where the cancer has spread.   the following treatment is being studied for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma:          - a clinical trial of immunotherapy (vaccine therapy).        check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with previously untreated childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.

                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. after the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.    there are different types of immunotherapy:            -  immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:                  -  ctla-4 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when ctla-4 attaches to another protein called b7 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. ctla-4 inhibitors attach to ctla-4 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. ipilimumab is a type of ctla-4 inhibitor.       -  pd-1 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. when pd-1 attaches to another protein called pdl-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell. pd-1 inhibitors attach to pdl-1 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells. nivolumab and pembrolizumab are pd-1 inhibitors.                -  vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.              targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do. there are different types of targeted therapy:            -  mtor inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive. sirolimus is a type of mtor inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. mk-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. the monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. the drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials."
how many people are affected by rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata ?,"rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. rcdp1 is more common than rcdp2 or rcdp3."
is gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what are the genetic changes related to lysinuric protein intolerance ?,"mutations in the slc7a7 gene cause lysinuric protein intolerance. the slc7a7 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called y+l amino acid transporter 1 (y+lat-1), which is involved in transporting lysine, arginine, and ornithine between cells in the body. the transportation of amino acids from the small intestines and kidneys to the rest of the body is necessary for the body to be able to use proteins. mutations in the y+lat-1 protein disrupt the transportation of amino acids, leading to a shortage of lysine, arginine, and ornithine in the body and an abnormally large amount of these amino acids in urine.  a shortage of lysine, arginine, and ornithine disrupts many vital functions. arginine and ornithine are involved in a cellular process called the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) that is generated when protein is used by the body. the lack of arginine and ornithine in the urea cycle causes elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. lysine is particularly abundant in collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues such as skin, tendons, and ligaments. a deficiency of lysine contributes to the short stature and osteoporosis seen in people with lysinuric protein intolerance. other features of lysinuric protein intolerance are thought to result from abnormal protein transport (such as protein deposits in the lungs) or a lack of protein that can be used by the body (protein malnutrition)."

how to diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors ?,"imaging studies and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors. the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. the testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. a history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   serum tumor marker test : a procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. these are called tumor markers.  most malignant germ cell tumors release tumor markers. the following tumor markers are used to detect extracranial germ cell tumors:                - alpha-fetoprotein (afp).      - beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg).          for testicular germ cell tumors, blood levels of the tumor markers help show if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri).    -   ultrasound exam: a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. the picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   biopsy : the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. in some cases, the tumor is removed during surgery and then a biopsy is done. the following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  cytogenetic analysis : a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.       -  immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer."
what causes henoch-schnlein purpura ?,"henoch-schnlein purpura is caused by an abnormal immune system response in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. usually, the immune system makes antibodies, or proteins, to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. in hsp, these antibodies attack the blood vessels. the factors that cause this immune system response are not known. however, in 30 to 50 percent of cases, people have an upper respiratory tract infection, such as a cold, before getting hsp.2 hsp has also been associated with
                
- infectious agents such as chickenpox, measles, hepatitis, and hiv viruses  - medications  - foods  - insect bites  - exposure to cold weather  - trauma
                
genetics may increase the risk of hsp, as it has occurred in different members of the same family, including in twins."

what are the genetic changes related to dandy-walker malformation ?,"researchers have found mutations in a few genes that are thought to cause dandy-walker malformation, but these mutations account for only a small number of cases. dandy-walker malformation has also been associated with many chromosomal abnormalities. this condition can be a feature of some conditions in which there is an extra copy of one chromosome in each cell (trisomy). dandy-walker malformation most often occurs in people with trisomy 18 (an extra copy of chromosome 18), but can also occur in people with trisomy 13, trisomy 21, or trisomy 9. this condition can also be associated with missing (deletions) or copied (duplications) pieces of certain chromosomes. dandy-walker malformation can also be a feature of genetic syndromes that are caused by mutations in specific genes. however, the brain malformations associated with dandy-walker malformation often occur as an isolated feature (not associated with other health problems), and in these cases the cause is frequently unknown.  research suggests that dandy-walker malformation could be caused by environmental factors that affect early development before birth. for example, exposure of the fetus to substances that cause birth defects (teratogens) may be involved in the development of this condition. in addition, a mother with diabetes is more likely than a healthy mother to have a child with dandy-walker malformation."
what is (are) pneumonia ?,"pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. many germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia. you can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. people most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age, or already have health problems.    symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. see your doctor promptly if you       - have a high fever    - have shaking chills    - have a cough with phlegm that doesn't improve or gets worse    - develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities    - have chest pain when you breathe or cough    - feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu       your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. treatment depends on what kind you have. if bacteria are the cause, antibiotics should help. if you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.    preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for kidney disease ?,"there are many researchers who are working on kidney disease. they are looking for ways to improve diagnosis, make treatments more effective, and make dialysis and transplantation work better. several areas of research supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk) hold great potential. emphasis is being placed on research related to prevention and early intervention in kidney disease. another focus is on the interaction between diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. advances in treatments for diabetes and high blood pressure may help reduce the damage these conditions do to the kidneys in the first place. research into how to predict who will develop kidney disease may improve prevention."
do you have information about pacemakers and implantable defibrillators,"summary : an arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. it means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. if your arrhythmia is serious, you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd). they are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.    a pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. it uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. it can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart.    an icd monitors heart rhythms. if it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. this treatment is called defibrillation. an icd can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (sca). most new icds can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. many icds also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. this can help the doctor plan future treatment.    getting a pacemaker or icd requires minor surgery. you usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. you will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days."
is meesmann corneal dystrophy inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered krt12 or krt3 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most cases, an affected person inherits the condition from an affected parent."
what is (are) protein s deficiency ?,"protein s deficiency is a disorder of blood clotting. people with this condition have an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots.  individuals with mild protein s deficiency are at risk of a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) that occurs in the deep veins of the arms or legs. if a dvt travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism (pe). other factors can raise the risk of abnormal blood clots in people with mild protein s deficiency. these factors include increasing age, surgery, immobility, or pregnancy. the combination of protein s deficiency and other inherited disorders of blood clotting can also influence risk. many people with mild protein s deficiency never develop an abnormal blood clot, however.  in severe cases of protein s deficiency, infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. purpura fulminans is characterized by the formation of blood clots within small blood vessels throughout the body. these blood clots disrupt normal blood flow and can lead to death of body tissue (necrosis). widespread blood clotting uses up all available blood clotting proteins. as a result, abnormal bleeding occurs in various parts of the body and is often noticeable as large, purple skin lesions. individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrent episodes of purpura fulminans."
who is at risk for prostate cancer? ?,"different factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer. anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease is called a risk factor. anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.   for information about risk factors and protective factors for prostate cancer, see the pdq summary on prostate cancer prevention."
how many people are affected by benign essential blepharospasm ?,"benign essential blepharospasm affects an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people in the united states. for unknown reasons, it occurs in women more than twice as often as it occurs in men."

what is (are) moebius syndrome ?,"moebius syndrome is a rare neurological condition that primarily affects the muscles that control facial expression and eye movement. signs and symptoms of the condition may include weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles; feeding, swallowing, and choking problems; excessive drooling; crossed eyes; lack of facial expression; eye sensitivity; high or cleft palate; hearing problems; dental abnormalities; bone abnormalities in the hands and feet; and/or speech difficulties. affected children often experience delayed development of motor skills (such as crawling and walking), although most eventually acquire these skills. moebius syndrome is caused by the absence or underdevelopment of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves, which control eye movement and facial expression. other cranial nerves may also be affected. there is no cure for moebius syndrome, but proper care and treatment give many individuals a normal life expectancy."
what are the treatments for autoimmune hepatitis ?,"treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. treatment may also include a liver transplant.
                
treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. people with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver.
                
medications
                
people with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. a health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. in some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function.
                
corticosteroids. corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. the treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease.
                
side effects of prednisone may include
                
- weight gain  - weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia  - thinning of the hair and skin  - acne  - diabetes  - high blood pressure  - cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes  - glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes  - anxiety and confusion
                
a health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis.
                
immune system suppressors. medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. in most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (azasan, imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. when using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects.
                
side effects of azathioprine include
                
- low white blood cell count  - nausea  - vomiting  - skin rash  - liver damage  - pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas
                
azathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. a low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. a health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done.
                
a person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. the risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis.
                
a health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. when a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years.
                
people who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (hecoria, prograf).
                
medications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. people on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer.
                
liver transplant
                
in some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and
                
- generalized itching  - a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - a swollen stomach or swollen ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin  - abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver  - fluid in the abdomenalso called ascites  - forgetfulness or confusion
                
liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. a team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. when possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the surgery. the patient stays in the hospital about 1 to 2 weeks to be sure the transplanted liver is functioning properly. the health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. the patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases.
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic, liver transplantation."
what are the genetic changes related to progressive familial heart block ?,"mutations in the scn5a and trpm4 genes cause most cases of progressive familial heart block types ia and ib, respectively. the proteins produced from these genes are channels that allow positively charged atoms (cations) into and out of cells. both channels are abundant in heart (cardiac) cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. these channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the atria and ventricles, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.  the scn5a and trpm4 gene mutations that cause progressive familial heart block alter the normal function of the channels. as a result of these channel alterations, cardiac cells have difficulty producing and transmitting the electrical signals that are necessary to coordinate normal heartbeats, leading to heart block. death of these impaired cardiac cells over time can lead to fibrosis, worsening the heart block.  mutations in other genes, some of which are unknown, account for the remaining cases of progressive familial heart block."
what is (are) zika virus ?,"zika is a virus that is spread by mosquitoes. a pregnant mother can pass it to her baby during pregnancy or around the time of birth. a man can spread it to his partner during sexual contact. there have also been reports that the virus has spread through blood transfusions. there have been outbreaks of zika virus in africa, southeast asia, the pacific islands, parts of the caribbean, and central and south america.    most people who get the virus do not get sick. one in five people do get symptoms, which can include a fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pinkeye). symptoms are usually mild, and start 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.    a blood test can tell whether you have the infection. there are no vaccines or medicines to treat it. drinking lots of fluids, resting, and taking acetaminophen might help.    zika can cause microcephaly (a serious birth defect of the brain) and other problems in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant. the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that pregnant women do not travel to areas where there is a zika virus outbreak. if you do decide to travel, first talk to your doctor. you should also be careful to prevent mosquito bites:       - use insect repellent    - wear clothes that cover your arms, legs, and feet    - stay in places that have air conditioning or that use window and door screens       centers for disease control and prevention"
what are the symptoms of brittle diabetes ?,"what are the symptoms of brittle diabetes? the main symptom of brittle diabetes is severe instability of blood glucose levels with frequent and unpredictable episodes of hypoglycemia and/or ketoacidosis that cause a disruption of daily activities. three clinical presentations have been described: predominant hyperglycemia with recurrent ketoacidosis, predominant hypoglycemia, and mixed hyper- and hypoglycemia. patients with brittle diabetes have wide swings in their blood sugar levels and often experience differing blood sugar responses to the same dose and type of insulin. complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy are common. most patients are females in their twenties of thirties, though any age or gender can be affected."

what are the treatments for heart failure ?,"for severe heart failure, patients may require additional oxygen, a mechanical heart pump, or a heart transplant."
how many people are affected by nemaline myopathy ?,"nemaline myopathy has an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 individuals."
what are the treatments for abdominal adhesions ?,"abdominal adhesions that do not cause symptoms generally do not require treatment. surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause pain, intestinal obstruction, or fertility problems. more surgery, however, carries the risk of additional abdominal adhesions. people should speak with their health care provider about the best way to treat their abdominal adhesions.
                
complete intestinal obstructions usually require immediate surgery to clear the blockage. most partial intestinal obstructions can be managed without surgery."
is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what is (are) bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria ?,"bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (bpp) is a rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). signs and symptoms include partial paralysis of muscles on both sides of the face, tongue, jaws, and throat; difficulties in speaking, chewing, and swallowing; and/or seizures. in most cases, mild to severe intellectual disability is also present. while the exact cause of bpp is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. most cases of bpp occur sporadically in people with no family history of the disorder; however, more than one family member may rarely be affected by the condition. treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."
what are the treatments for microcephaly ?,"there is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a childs head to a normal size or shape. treatment focuses on ways to decrease the impact of the associated deformities and neurological disabilities. children with microcephaly and developmental delays are usually evaluated by a pediatric neurologist and followed by a medical management team. early childhood intervention programs that involve physical, speech, and occupational therapists help to maximize abilities and minimize dysfunction. medications are often used to control seizures, hyperactivity, and neuromuscular symptoms. genetic counseling may help families understand the risk for microcephaly in subsequent pregnancies."
do you have information about islet cell transplantation,"summary : islets are cells found in clusters throughout the pancreas. they are made up of several types of cells. one of these is beta cells, which make insulin. insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. it is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.    in type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. a person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. transplanted islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. the beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. researchers hope islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily insulin injections.    nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases"
what is (are) hyperglycemia ?,"hyperglycemia means high blood sugar or glucose. glucose comes from the foods you eat. insulin is a hormone that moves glucose into your cells to give them energy. hyperglycemia happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way.    people with diabetes can get hyperglycemia from not eating the right foods or not taking medicines correctly. other problems that can raise blood sugar include infections, certain medicines, hormone imbalances, or severe illnesses."
how to diagnose wilson disease ?,"a health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose wilson disease, including the following:
                
- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - urine tests  - liver biopsy  - imaging tests
                
health care providers typically see the same symptoms of wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.
                
medical and family history
                
a health care provider may take a medical and family history to help diagnose wilson disease.
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam may help diagnose wilson disease. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen
                
a health care provider will use a special light called a slit lamp to look for kayser-fleischer rings in the eyes.
                
blood tests
                
a nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. a health care provider may
                
- perform liver enzyme or function testsblood tests that may indicate liver abnormalities.  - check copper levels in the blood. since the copper is deposited into the organs and is not circulating in the blood, most people with wilson disease have a lower-than-normal level of copper in the blood. in cases of acute liver failure caused by wilson disease, the level of blood copper is often higher than normal.  - check the level of ceruloplasmina protein that carries copper in the bloodstream. most people with wilson disease have a lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin level.  - conduct genetic testing. a health care provider may recommend genetic testing in cases of a known family history of wilson disease.
                
urine tests
                
24-hour urine collection. a patient will collect urine at home in a special container provided by a health care providers office or a commercial facility. a health care provider sends the sample to a lab for analysis. a 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who have symptoms due to wilson disease.
                
liver biopsy
                
a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. he or she may also ask the patient to fasteat or drink nothingfor 8 hours before the procedure.
                
during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. the health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. if needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. the health care provider uses the needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. he or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. after the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the liver tissue in a lab. the test can show cirrhosis of the liver. sometimes the liver biopsy will show copper buildup in the liver cells; however, the results can vary because the copper does not always deposit evenly into the liver. therefore, health care providers often find it more useful to analyze a piece of liver tissue for copper content. most patients with wilson disease have high levels of copper in the liver tissue when compared with carriers or with people who do not have wilson disease.
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic, liver biopsy.
                
imaging tests
                
a health care provider may order imaging tests to evaluate brain abnormalities in patients who have nervous system symptoms often seen with wilson disease, or in patients diagnosed with wilson disease. health care providers do not use brain imaging tests to diagnose wilson disease, though certain findings may suggest the patient has the disease.
                
magnetic resonance imaging (mri). an mri is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. the patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. an mri may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. with most mri machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. the technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the brain. during sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises. mri can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.
                
computerized tomography (ct) scan. a ct scan uses a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. for a ct scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of contrast medium. ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. an x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. a radiologist interprets the images. the patient does not need anesthesia. a ct scan can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms."
what is (are) greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ?,"greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome is a disorder that affects development of the limbs, head, and face. the features of this syndrome are highly variable, ranging from very mild to severe. people with this condition typically have one or more extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) or an abnormally wide thumb or big toe (hallux). the skin between the fingers and toes may be fused (cutaneous syndactyly). this disorder is also characterized by widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), an abnormally large head size (macrocephaly), and a high, prominent forehead. rarely, affected individuals may have more serious medical problems including seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability."

                    - retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina.    - retinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms.     -  treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling.    - children with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma.     - a child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers.    - signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include ""white pupil"" and eye pain or redness.     - tests that examine the retina are used to detect (find) and diagnose retinoblastoma.    - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina.
                    the retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. the retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerve.      although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years. the cancer may be in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). retinoblastoma rarely spreads from the eye to nearby tissue or other parts of the body.    cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities (hollow spaces) form within the tumor.
                
                
                    treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling.
                    parents should receive genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about the risk of genetic diseases) to discuss genetic testing to check for a mutation (change) in the rb1 gene. genetic counseling also includes a discussion of the risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters."

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer.
                    treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. the medical oncologist works with other doctors who are experts in treating patients with head and neck cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine and rehabilitation. patients who have paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer may need special help adjusting to breathing problems or other side effects of the cancer and its treatment. if a large amount of tissue or bone around the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity is taken out, plastic surgery may be done to repair or rebuild the area. the treatment team may include the following specialists:          -  radiation oncologist.    -  neurologist.    -  oral surgeon or head and neck surgeon.    -  plastic surgeon.    -  dentist.    -  nutritionist.    -  speech and language pathologist.    -  rehabilitation specialist.
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery      surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. a doctor may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue and bone around the cancer. if the cancer has spread, the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck.     even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:             -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. the total dose of radiation therapy is sometimes divided into several smaller, equal doses delivered over a period of several days. this is called fractionation.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.    external radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works. the thyroid hormone levels in the blood may be tested before and after treatment.       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information. (paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

is x-linked creatine deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an x-linked pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may or may not cause the disorder. in males (who have only one x chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons.  in most cases of x-linked inheritance, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. about half of females with one mutated copy of the slc6a8 gene in each cell have intellectual disability, learning difficulties, or behavioral problems. other females with one mutated copy of the slc6a8 gene in each cell have no noticeable neurological problems."
what is (are) pleural disorders ?,"your pleura is a large, thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. between the layers of the pleura is a very thin space. normally it's filled with a small amount of fluid. the fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as your lungs breathe air in and out.    disorders of the pleura include       - pleurisy - inflammation of the pleura that causes sharp pain with breathing    - pleural effusion - excess fluid in the pleural space    - pneumothorax - buildup of air or gas in the pleural space    - hemothorax - buildup of blood in the pleural space       many different conditions can cause pleural problems. viral infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. the most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure. lung diseases, like copd, tuberculosis, and acute lung injury, cause pneumothorax. injury to the chest is the most common cause of hemothorax. treatment focuses on removing fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space, relieving symptoms, and treating the underlying condition.    nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute"
what are the genetic changes related to jacobsen syndrome ?,"jacobsen syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material at the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11. the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, with most affected people missing 5 million to 16 million dna building blocks (also written as 5 mb to 16 mb). in almost all affected people, the deletion includes the tip of chromosome 11. larger deletions tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms than smaller deletions.  the features of jacobsen syndrome are likely related to the loss of multiple genes on chromosome 11. depending on its size, the deleted region can contain from about 170 to more than 340 genes. many of these genes have not been well characterized. however, genes in this region appear to be critical for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain, facial features, and heart. only a few genes have been studied as possible contributors to the specific features of jacobsen syndrome; researchers are working to determine which additional genes may be associated with this condition."

what is (are) glycogen storage disease type i ?,"glycogen storage disease type i (also known as gsdi or von gierke disease) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar called glycogen in the body's cells. the accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally.  signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear around the age of 3 or 4 months, when babies start to sleep through the night and do not eat as frequently as newborns. affected infants may have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can lead to seizures. they can also have a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), high blood levels of a waste product called uric acid (hyperuricemia), and excess amounts of fats in the blood (hyperlipidemia). as they get older, children with gsdi have thin arms and legs and short stature. an enlarged liver may give the appearance of a protruding abdomen. the kidneys may also be enlarged. affected individuals may also have diarrhea and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas).  people with gsdi may experience delayed puberty. beginning in young to mid-adulthood, affected individuals may have thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), a form of arthritis resulting from uric acid crystals in the joints (gout), kidney disease, and high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). females with this condition may also have abnormal development of the ovaries (polycystic ovaries). in affected teens and adults, tumors called adenomas may form in the liver. adenomas are usually noncancerous (benign), but occasionally these tumors can become cancerous (malignant).  researchers have described two types of gsdi, which differ in their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. these types are known as glycogen storage disease type ia (gsdia) and glycogen storage disease type ib (gsdib). two other forms of gsdi have been described, and they were originally named types ic and id. however, these types are now known to be variations of gsdib; for this reason, gsdib is sometimes called gsd type i non-a.  many people with gsdib have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent bacterial infections. neutropenia is usually apparent by age 1. many affected individuals also have inflammation of the intestinal walls (inflammatory bowel disease). people with gsdib may have oral problems including cavities, inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), chronic gum (periodontal) disease, abnormal tooth development, and open sores (ulcers) in the mouth. the neutropenia and oral problems are specific to people with gsdib and are typically not seen in people with gsdia."

how to prevent diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes ?,"a major research study, the diabetes prevention program (dpp), proved that people with prediabetes were able to sharply reduce their risk of developing diabetes during the study by losing 5 to 7 percent of their body weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity.
                
study participants followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet and engaged in regular physical activity, such as walking briskly five times a week for 30 minutes. these strategies worked well for both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups, but were especially effective for participants age 60 and older. a follow-up study, the diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos), showed losing weight and being physically active provide lasting results. ten years after the dpp, modest weight loss delayed onset of type 2 diabetes by an average of 4 years.
                
the diabetes medication metformin also lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes, especially those who are younger and heavier and women who have had gestational diabetes. the dppos showed that metformin delayed type 2 diabetes by 2 years. people at high risk should ask their health care provider if they should take metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes. metformin is a medication that makes insulin work better and can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

how to diagnose hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 ?,"is genetic testing available for hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1? at least four genes responsible for hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (hsn1) have been found: hsn1a (the most common form) is associated with mutations in the sptlc1 gene hsn1b, reported in a small number of families, is linked to a specific location on chromosome 3, but the exact gene has not yet been identified hsn1c is caused by mutations in the sptlc2 gene hsn1d is caused by mutations in the atl1 gene (the same gene is associated with early-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia 3a) hsn1e is caused by mutations in the dnmt1 gene the genetic testing registry (gtr) provides information about genetic testing for hsn1a. the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers. patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. although the genes for some other types of hsn1 have been identified, we are not aware of clinical laboratories that offer genetic testing for them. a genetics professional may be able to help you locate laboratories that offer testing for other types of hsn1. if the genetic mutation in an affected person has been identified, testing for adult relatives at risk for developing symptoms may be possible. this is called predictive genetic testing. however, this testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in people who currently don't have symptoms."
what are the treatments for cramp-fasciculation syndrome ?,"how might cramp-fasciculation syndrome be treated? there is limited information in the medical literature about the treatment of cramp-fasciculation syndrome (cfs). much of what is available describes individual cases. some people with cfs improve without treatment. treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, or pregabalin (medications that reduce the hyper-excitability of nerves) was described as helpful in improving symptoms in individual cases. immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., prednisone) has been used to treat cases of cfs that did not respond to other treatments. for severe cases, additional treatment options may be considered. decisions regarding treatment should be carefully considered and discussed with a knowledgeable healthcare provider."
is congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency inherited ?,"this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
what causes protein c deficiency ?,"what causes protein c deficiency? protein c deficiency can be inherited or acquired later in life. inherited protein c deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene that provides instructions for making protein c, called the proc gene. these mutations disrupt the protein's ability to control blood clotting. if protein c cannot control blood clotting, abnormal blood clots may form. acquired protein c deficiency may be caused by large blood clots, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic), infection (sepsis), and vitamin k deficiency. treatment with warfarin or certain types of chemotherapy can also cause acquired protein c deficiency."
what is (are) familial adenomatous polyposis ?,"familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) is an inherited disorder characterized by cancer of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. people with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their teenage years. unless the colon is removed, these polyps will become malignant (cancerous). the average age at which an individual develops colon cancer in classic familial adenomatous polyposis is 39 years. some people have a variant of the disorder, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, in which polyp growth is delayed. the average age of colorectal cancer onset for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis is 55 years.  in people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon. also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid tumors. these fibrous tumors usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. desmoid tumors tend to recur after they are surgically removed. in both classic familial adenomatous polyposis and its attenuated variant, benign and malignant tumors are sometimes found in other places in the body, including the duodenum (a section of the small intestine), stomach, bones, skin, and other tissues. people who have colon polyps as well as growths outside the colon are sometimes described as having gardner syndrome.  a milder type of familial adenomatous polyposis, called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis, has also been identified. people with the autosomal recessive type of this disorder have fewer polyps than those with the classic type. fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or thousands. the autosomal recessive type of this disorder is caused by mutations in a different gene than the classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis."
what are the treatments for lipodermatosclerosis ?,"how might lipodermatosclerosis be treated? lipodermatosclerosis is primarily treated with compression therapy to improve venous insufficiency. other strategies for managing venous insufficiency include leg elevation; not sitting or standing in one place for long periods of time; regular exercise; and weight loss if overweight or obese. some affected people may require medications to prevent blood clotting; reduce pain and inflammation; and/or increase blood flow. depending on the severity of the condition and the response to initial treatments, vein surgery may be recommended."
what is (are) phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency ?,"phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy source for most cells. researchers have described two major forms of the condition. the most common form is sometimes called the hemolytic form. it is characterized by a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. some people with the hemolytic form also have symptoms related to abnormal brain function, including intellectual disability, seizures, and stroke.  the other form of phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is often called the myopathic form. it primarily affects muscles, causing progressive weakness, pain, and cramping, particularly with exercise. during exercise, muscle tissue can be broken down, releasing a protein called myoglobin. this protein is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). if untreated, myoglobinuria can lead to kidney failure.  most people with phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency have either the hemolytic form or the myopathic form. however, other combinations of signs and symptoms (such as muscle weakness with neurologic symptoms) have also been reported."

what are the genetic changes related to intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?,"in some individuals with primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction, the condition is caused by mutations in the flna gene. this gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin a, which helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. filamin a attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps it form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton.  some individuals with primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction have flna gene mutations that result in an abnormally short filamin a protein. others have duplications or deletions of genetic material in the flna gene. researchers believe that these genetic changes may impair the function of the filamin a protein, causing abnormalities in the cytoskeleton of nerve cells (neurons) in the gastrointestinal tract. these abnormalities interfere with the nerves' ability to produce the coordinated waves of muscle contractions (peristalsis) that move food through the digestive tract.  deletions or duplications of genetic material that affect the flna gene can also include adjacent genes on the x chromosome. changes in adjacent genes may account for some of the other signs and symptoms that can occur with intestinal pseudo-obstruction.  secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction may result from other disorders that damage muscles or nerves, such as parkinson disease, diabetes, or muscular dystrophy. additionally, the condition is a feature of an inherited disease called mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease (mngie disease) that affects the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). infections, surgery, or certain drugs can also cause secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction.  in some affected individuals, the cause of intestinal pseudo-obstruction is unknown. studies suggest that in some cases the condition may result from mutations in other genes that have not been identified."
what is (are) urea cycle disorders ?,"a urea cycle disorder is a genetic disorder that results in a deficiency of one of the six enzymes in the urea cycle. these enzymes are responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. the urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which nitrogen, a waste product of protein metabolism, is changed to a compound called urea and removed from the blood. normally, the urea is removed from the body through the urine. in urea cycle disorders, nitrogen builds up in the blood in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance, resulting in hyperammonemia (elevated blood ammonia). ammonia then reaches the brain through the blood, where it can cause irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. the onset and severity of urea cycle disorders is highly variable. the severity correlates with the amount of urea cycle enzyme function."
what is (are) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. this condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. in affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. this destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.  the most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. this type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. in people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).  glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms."

what is (are) insomnia ?,"espaol
                
insomnia (in-som-ne-ah) is a common sleep disorder. people who have insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. as a result, they may get too little sleep or have poor-quality sleep. they may not feel refreshed when they wake up.
                
overview
                
insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). acute insomnia is common and often is brought on by situations such as stress at work, family pressures, or a traumatic event. acute insomnia lasts for days or weeks.
                
chronic insomnia lasts for a month or longer. most cases of chronic insomnia are secondary, which means they are the symptom or side effect of some other problem. certain medical conditions, medicines, sleep disorders, and substances can cause secondary insomnia.
                
in contrast, primary insomnia isn't due to medical problems, medicines, or other substances. it is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isnt well understood. many life changes can trigger primary insomnia, including long-lasting stress and emotional upset.
                
insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness and a lack of energy. it also can make you feel anxious, depressed, or irritable. you may have trouble focusing on tasks, paying attention, learning, and remembering. these problems can prevent you from doing your best at work or school.
                
insomnia also can cause other serious problems. for example, you may feel drowsy while driving, which could lead to an accident.
                
outlook
                
treating the underlying cause of secondary insomnia may resolve or improve the sleep problem, especially if you can correct the problem soon after it starts. for example, if caffeine is causing your insomnia, stopping or limiting your intake of the substance might make the insomnia go away.
                
lifestyle changes, including better sleep habits, often help relieve acute insomnia. for chronic insomnia, your doctor may recommend medicines or cognitive-behavioral therapy."
what is (are) familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection ?,"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial taad) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. familial taad affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. this part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.  in familial taad, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. these aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).  the occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. they can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial taad to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.  aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. however, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.  familial taad may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. however, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called marfan syndrome or loeys-dietz syndrome. these features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. occasionally, people with familial taad develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). some people with familial taad have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). however, these conditions are also common in the general population. depending on the genetic cause of familial taad in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke."

is non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency inherited ?,"is non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency inherited? non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (ncah) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. this means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."
what is the outlook for landau-kleffner syndrome ?,"the prognosis for children with lks varies. some affected children may have a permanent severe language disorder, while others may regain much of their language abilities (although it may take months or years). in some cases, remission and relapse may occur. the prognosis is improved when the onset of the disorder is after age 6 and when speech therapy is started early. seizures generally disappear by adulthood."
what is the outlook for adult non-hodgkin lymphoma ?,"certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - the stage of the cancer.    - the type of non-hodgkin lymphoma.     - the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in the blood.    - whether there are certain changes in the genes.    - the patients age and general health.    - whether the lymphoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        for non-hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, the treatment options also depend on:         - the wishes of the patient.    - which trimester of pregnancy the patient is in.    - whether the baby can be delivered early.        some types of non-hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than others do. most non-hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are aggressive. delaying treatment of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. immediate treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy."

what are the genetic changes related to hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy ?,"mutations in the sept9 gene cause hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. the sept9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called septin-9, which is part of a group of proteins called septins. septins are involved in a process called cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells.  the sept9 gene seems to be turned on (active) in cells throughout the body. approximately 15 slightly different versions (isoforms) of the septin-9 protein may be produced from this gene. some types of cells make certain isoforms, while other cell types produce other isoforms. however, the specific distribution of these isoforms in the body's tissues is not well understood. septin-9 isoforms interact with other septin proteins to perform some of their functions.  mutations in the sept9 gene may change the sequence of protein building blocks (amino acids) in certain septin-9 isoforms in ways that interfere with their function. these mutations may also change the distribution of septin-9 isoforms and their interactions with other septin proteins in some of the body's tissues. this change in the functioning of septin proteins seems to particularly affect the brachial plexus, but the reason for this is unknown.  because many of the triggers for hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy also affect the immune system, researchers believe that an autoimmune reaction may be involved in this disorder. however, the relation between sept9 mutations and immune function is unclear. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. an autoimmune attack on the nerves in the brachial plexus likely results in the signs and symptoms of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy.  at least 15 percent of families affected by hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy do not have sept9 gene mutations. in these cases, the disorder is believed to be caused by mutations in a gene that has not been identified."
what is (are) ovarian disorders ?,"the ovaries are a pair of organs that women have. they are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    the ovaries produce a woman's eggs. if an egg is fertilized by a sperm, a pregnancy can result. ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. when a woman goes through menopause, her ovaries stop releasing eggs and make far lower levels of hormones.    problems with the ovaries include       - ovarian cancer    - ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome    - premature ovarian failure    - ovarian torsion, a twisting of the ovary"

what is (are) hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ii ?,"hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type ii (hsan2) is a condition that primarily affects the sensory nerve cells (sensory neurons), which transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. these sensations are impaired in people with hsan2. in some affected people, the condition may also cause mild abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. the signs and symptoms of hsan2 typically begin in infancy or early childhood.  the first sign of hsan2 is usually numbness in the hands and feet. soon after, affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. people with hsan2 often develop open sores (ulcers) on their hands and feet. because affected individuals cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek treatment right away. without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may lead to amputation of the affected area. unintentional self-injury is common in people with hsan2, typically by biting the tongue, lips, or fingers. these injuries may lead to spontaneous amputation of the affected areas. affected individuals often have injuries and fractures in their hands, feet, limbs, and joints that go untreated because of the inability to feel pain. repeated injury can lead to a condition called charcot joints, in which the bones and tissue surrounding joints are destroyed.  the effects of hsan2 on the autonomic nervous system are more variable. some infants with hsan2 have trouble sucking, which makes it difficult for them to eat. people with hsan2 may experience episodes in which breathing slows or stops for short periods (apnea); digestive problems such as the backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux); or slow eye blink or gag reflexes. affected individuals may also have weak deep tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer.  some people with hsan2 lose a type of taste bud on the tip of the tongue called lingual fungiform papillae and have a diminished sense of taste."
what causes lung cancer ?,"cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. scientists have reported widely on the link between cancer and smoking since the 1960s. since then, study after study has provided more proof that cigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer. before cigarette smoking became popular after world war i, doctors rarely, if ever, saw patients with lung cancer. but today, lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer. over 85 percent of people with lung cancer developed it because they smoked cigarettes. using tobacco products has been shown to cause many types of cancer. in fact, smoking tobacco, using smokeless tobacco, and being exposed regularly to second-hand tobacco smoke are responsible for a large number of cancer deaths in the u.s. each year."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for parkinson's disease ?,"in recent years, research on parkinson's has advanced to the point that halting the progression of the disease, restoring lost function, and even preventing the disease are all considered realistic goals. while the goal of preventing parkinson's disease may take years to achieve, researchers are making great progress in understanding and treating it. genetics research one of the most exciting areas of parkinson's research is genetics. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases of the disease. identifying gene defects can also help researchers -  understand how parkinson's occurs  -  develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in humans  - identify new approaches to drug therapy  - improve diagnosis.  understand how parkinson's occurs develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in humans identify new approaches to drug therapy improve diagnosis. researchers funded by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke are gathering information and dna samples from hundreds of families with members who have parkinson's and are conducting large-scale studies to identify gene variants that are associated with increased risk of developing the disease. they are also comparing gene activity in parkinson's with gene activity in similar diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy. in addition to identifying new genes for parkinson's disease, researchers are trying to learn about the function of genes known to be associated with the disease, and about how gene mutations cause disease. effects of environmental toxins scientists continue to study environmental toxins such as pesticides and herbicides that can cause parkinson's symptoms in animals. they have found that exposing rodents to the pesticide rotenone and several other agricultural chemicals can cause cellular and behavioral changes that mimic those seen in parkinson's. role of lewy bodies other studies focus on how lewy bodies form and what role they play in parkinson's disease. some studies suggest that lewy bodies are a byproduct of a breakdown that occurs within nerve cells, while others indicate that lewy bodies are protective, helping neurons ""lock away"" abnormal molecules that might otherwise be harmful. identifying biomarkers biomarkers for parkinson's -- measurable characteristics that can reveal whether the disease is developing or progressing -- are another focus of research. such biomarkers could help doctors detect the disease before symptoms appear and improve diagnosis of the disease. they also would show if medications and other types of therapy have a positive or negative effect on the course of the disease. the national disorders of neurological disorders and stroke has developed an initiative, the parkinsons disease biomarkers identification network (pd-bin), designed specifically to address these questions and to discover and validate biomarkers for parkinsons disease. transcranial therapies researchers are conducting many studies of new or improved therapies for parkinson's disease. studies are testing whether transcranial electrical polarization (tep) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) can reduce the symptoms of the disease. in tep, electrodes placed on the scalp are used to generate an electrical current that modifies signals in the brain's cortex. in tms, an insulated coil of wire on the scalp is used to generate a brief electrical current. drug discovery a variety of new drug treatments for parkinson's disease are in clinical trials. several mao-b inhibitors including selegiline, lazabemide, and rasagiline, are being tested to determine if they have neuroprotective effects in people with parkinsons disease. the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has launched a broad effort to find drugs to slow the progression of parkinson's disease, called net-pd or nih exploratory trials in parkinson's disease. the first studies tested several compounds; one of these, creatine, is now being evaluated in a larger clinical trial. the net-pd investigators are testing a highly purified form of creatine, a nutritional supplement, to find out if it slows the decline seen in people with parkinson's. creatine is a widely used dietary supplement thought to improve exercise performance. cellular energy is stored in a chemical bond between creatine and a phosphate. more recently, net-pd has initiated pilot studies to test pioglitazone, a drug that has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial function. because mitochondrial function may be less active in parkinsons disease, this drug may protect vulnerable dopamine neurons by boosting mitochondrial function. cell implantation another potential approach to treating parkinson's disease is to implant cells to replace those lost in the disease. starting in the 1990s, researchers conducting a controlled clinical trial of fetal tissue implants tried to replace lost dopamine-producing nerve cells with healthy ones from fetal tissue in order to improve movement and the response to medications. while many of the implanted cells survived in the brain and produced dopamine, this therapy was associated with only modest functional improvements, mostly in patients under the age of 60. some of the people who received the transplants developed disabling dyskinesias that could not be relieved by reducing anti-parkinsonian medications. stem cells another type of cell therapy involves stem cells. some stem cells derived from embryos can develop into any kind of cell in the body, while others, called progenitor cells, are less flexible. researchers are developing methods to improve the number of dopamine-producing cells that can be grown from embryonic stem cells in culture. other researchers are also exploring whether stem cells from adult brains might be useful in treating parkinson's disease. recent studies suggest that some adult cells from skin can be reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state, resulting in induced pluripotent stem cells (ipsc) that may someday be used for treatment of parkinsons. in addition, development and characterization of cells from people with sporadic or inherited parkinsons may reveal information about cellular mechanisms of disease and identify targets for drug development. gene therapy a number of early clinical trials are now underway to test whether gene therapy can improve parkinson's disease. genes which are found to improve cellular function in models of parkinson's are inserted into modified viruses. the genetically engineered viruses are then injected into the brains of people with parkinson's disease. clinical studies have focused on the therapeutic potential of neurotrophic factors, including gdnf and neurturin, and enzymes that produce dopamine. these trials will test whether the viruses, by lending to the production of the protective gene product, improve symptoms of parkinson's over time. the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke also supports the morris k. udall centers of excellence for parkinson's disease research program . these centers, located across the usa, study cellular mechanisms underlying parkinsons disease, identify and characterize disease-associated genes, and discover and develop potential therapeutic targets. the centers' multidisciplinary research environment allows scientists to take advantage of new discoveries in the basic, translational and clinical sciences that could lead to clinical advances for parkinsons disease."
what is (are) spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 ?,"spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (sca36) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement that typically begin in mid-adulthood. people with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). affected individuals often have exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) and problems with speech (dysarthria). they also usually develop muscle twitches (fasciculations) of the tongue and over time, the muscles in the tongue waste away (atrophy). these tongue problems can cause difficulties swallowing liquids. as the condition progresses, individuals with sca36 develop muscle atrophy in the legs, forearms, and hands. another common feature of sca36 is the atrophy of specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons), which can contribute to the tongue and limb muscle atrophy in affected individuals.  some people with sca36 have abnormalities of the eye muscles, which can lead to involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), rapid eye movements (saccades), trouble moving the eyes side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia), and droopy eyelids (ptosis). sensorineural hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear, may also occur in people with sca36.  brain imaging of people with sca36 shows progressive atrophy of various parts of the brain, particularly within the cerebellum, which is the area of the brain involved in coordinating movements. over time, the loss of cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of sca36. in older affected individuals, the frontal lobes of the brain may show atrophy resulting in loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies.  signs and symptoms of sca36 typically begin in a person's forties or fifties but can appear anytime during adulthood. people with sca36 have a normal lifespan and are usually mobile for 15 to 20 years after they are diagnosed."

what is (are) vitamin d-dependent rickets ?,"vitamin d-dependent rickets is a disorder of bone development that leads to softening and weakening of the bones (rickets). the condition is split into two major types: type 1 (vddr1), which is also known as pseudovitamin d deficiency rickets or vitamin d 1-hydroxylase deficiency, and type 2 (vddr2), also known as hereditary vitamin d-resistant rickets (hvdrr).  the signs and symptoms of this condition begin within months of birth, and most are the same for vddr1 and vddr2. the weak bones often cause bone pain and delayed growth and have a tendency to fracture. when affected children begin to walk, they may develop bowed legs because the bones are too weak to bear weight. impaired bone development also results in widening of the areas near the ends of bones where new bone forms (metaphyses), especially in the knees, wrists, and ribs. some people with vitamin d-dependent rickets have dental abnormalities such as thin tooth enamel and frequent cavities. poor muscle tone (hypotonia) and muscle weakness are also common in this condition, and some affected individuals develop seizures.  in vitamin d-dependent rickets, there is an imbalance of certain substances in the blood. both vddr1 and vddr2 are characterized by low levels of the minerals calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia), which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. affected individuals also have high levels of a hormone involved in regulating calcium levels called parathyroid hormone (pth), which leads to a condition called secondary hyperparathyroidism. the two forms of vitamin d-dependent rickets can be distinguished by blood levels of a hormone called calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin d; individuals with vddr1 have abnormally low levels of calcitriol and individuals with vddr2 have abnormally high levels.  hair loss (alopecia) can occur in vddr2, although not everyone with this form of the condition has alopecia. affected individuals can have sparse or patchy hair or no hair at all on their heads. some affected individuals are missing body hair as well."

what is (are) mabry syndrome ?,"mabry syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood (hyperphosphatasia), and other signs and symptoms.  people with mabry syndrome have intellectual disability that is often moderate to severe. they typically have little to no speech development and are delayed in the development of motor skills (such as sitting, crawling, and walking). many affected individuals have low muscle tone (hypotonia) and develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in early childhood. seizures are usually the generalized tonic-clonic type, which involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness.  individuals with mabry syndrome have distinctive facial features that include wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), long openings of the eyelids (long palpebral fissures), a nose with a broad bridge and a rounded tip, downturned corners of the mouth, and a thin upper lip. these facial features usually become less pronounced over time.  hyperphosphatasia begins within the first year of life in people with mabry syndrome. there are many different types of alkaline phosphatase found in tissues; the type that is increased in mabry syndrome is called the tissue non-specific type and is found throughout the body. in affected individuals, alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood are usually increased by one to two times the normal amount, but can be up to 20 times higher than normal. the elevated enzyme levels remain relatively stable over a person's lifetime. hyperphosphatasia appears to cause no negative health effects, but this finding can help health professionals diagnose mabry syndrome.  another common feature of mabry syndrome is shortened bones at the ends of fingers (brachytelephalangy), which can be seen on x-ray imaging. underdeveloped fingernails (nail hypoplasia) may also occur. sometimes, individuals with mabry syndrome have abnormalities of the digestive system, including narrowing or blockage of the anus (anal stenosis or anal atresia) or hirschsprung disease, a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. rarely, affected individuals experience hearing loss.  the signs and symptoms of mabry syndrome vary among affected individuals. those who are least severely affected have only intellectual disability and hyperphosphatasia, without distinctive facial features or the other health problems listed above."
what are the genetic changes related to jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome ?,"mutations in the kcne1 and kcnq1 genes cause jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome.  the kcne1 and kcnq1 genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together to form a channel across cell membranes. these channels transport positively charged potassium atoms (ions) out of cells. the movement of potassium ions through these channels is critical for maintaining the normal functions of inner ear structures and cardiac muscle.  about 90 percent of cases of jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome are caused by mutations in the kcnq1 gene; kcne1 mutations are responsible for the remaining cases. mutations in these genes alter the usual structure and function of potassium channels or prevent the assembly of normal channels. these changes disrupt the flow of potassium ions in the inner ear and in cardiac muscle, leading to hearing loss and an irregular heart rhythm characteristic of jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome."
what are the symptoms of childhood soft tissue sarcoma ?,"the most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body. a sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm, a leg, or the trunk. there may be no other signs or symptoms at first. as the sarcoma gets bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, it may cause signs or symptoms, such as pain or weakness.   other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. check with your childs doctor if your child has any of these problems."

what are the genetic changes related to cowden syndrome ?,"changes involving at least four genes, pten, sdhb, sdhd, and klln, have been identified in people with cowden syndrome or cowden-like syndrome.  most cases of cowden syndrome and a small percentage of cases of cowden-like syndrome result from mutations in the pten gene. the protein produced from the pten gene is a tumor suppressor, which means that it normally prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. mutations in the pten gene prevent the protein from regulating cell proliferation effectively, leading to uncontrolled cell division and the formation of hamartomas and cancerous tumors. the pten gene likely has other important functions within cells; however, it is unclear how mutations in this gene cause the other features of cowden syndrome, such as macrocephaly and intellectual disability.  other cases of cowden syndrome and cowden-like syndrome result from changes involving the klln gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called killin. like the protein produced from the pten gene, killin probably acts as a tumor suppressor. the genetic change that causes cowden syndrome and cowden-like syndrome is known as promoter hypermethylation. the promoter is a region of dna near the gene that controls gene activity (expression). hypermethylation occurs when too many small molecules called methyl groups are attached to the promoter region. the extra methyl groups reduce the expression of the klln gene, which means that less killin is produced. a reduced amount of killin may allow abnormal cells to survive and proliferate inappropriately, which can lead to the formation of tumors.  a small percentage of people with cowden syndrome or cowden-like syndrome have variations in the sdhb or sdhd gene. these genes provide instructions for making parts of an enzyme called succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), which is important for energy production in the cell. this enzyme also plays a role in signaling pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation. variations in the sdhb or sdhd gene alter the function of the sdh enzyme. studies suggest that the defective enzyme may allow cells to grow and divide unchecked, leading to the formation of hamartomas and cancerous tumors. however, researchers are uncertain whether the identified sdhb and sdhd gene variants are directly associated with cowden syndrome and cowden-like syndrome. some of the variants described above have also been identified in people without the features of these conditions.  when cowden syndrome and cowden-like syndrome are not related to changes in the pten, sdhb, sdhd, or klln genes, the cause of the conditions is unknown."

what is (are) crohn disease ?,"crohn disease is a complex, chronic disorder that primarily affects the digestive system. this condition typically involves abnormal inflammation of the intestinal walls, particularly in the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and portions of the large intestine (the colon). inflammation can occur in any part of the digestive system, however. the inflamed tissues become thick and swollen, and the inner surface of the intestine may develop open sores (ulcers).  crohn disease most commonly appears in a person's late teens or twenties, although the disease can appear at any age. signs and symptoms tend to flare up multiple times throughout life. the most common features of this condition are persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fever. some people with crohn disease have chronic bleeding from inflamed tissues in the intestine; over time, this bleeding can lead to a low number of red blood cells (anemia). in some cases, crohn disease can also cause medical problems affecting the joints, eyes, or skin.  intestinal blockage is a common complication of crohn disease. blockages are caused by swelling or a buildup of scar tissue in the intestinal walls. some affected individuals also develop fistulae, which are abnormal connections between the intestine and other tissues. fistulae occur when ulcers break through the intestinal wall to form passages between loops of the intestine or between the intestine and nearby structures (such as the bladder, vagina, or skin).  crohn disease is one common form of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). another type of ibd, ulcerative colitis, also causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal lining. unlike crohn disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system, ulcerative colitis typically causes inflammation only in the colon. in addition, the two disorders involve different patterns of inflammation."

what causes pilomatrixoma ?,"what causes a pilomatrixoma? the exact underlying cause of pilomatrixoma is not well understood. changes (mutations) in the ctnnb1 gene are found in at least 75% of isolated (without other signs and symptoms) pilomatrixomas. these mutations are somatic, which means they are not inherited and are only present in the tumor cells. the ctnnb1 gene encodes a protein that is needed to regulate cell growth and attachment. when the gene is not working properly, it can result in abnormal cell growth. rarely, pilomatrixomas occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as gardner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and rubinstein-taybi syndrome. in these cases, affected people usually have other characteristic features of the associated condition."
what are the genetic changes related to propionic acidemia ?,"mutations in the pcca and pccb genes cause propionic acidemia.  the pcca and pccb genes provide instructions for making two parts (subunits) of an enzyme called propionyl-coa carboxylase. this enzyme plays a role in the normal breakdown of proteins. specifically, it helps process several amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. propionyl-coa carboxylase also helps break down certain types of fat and cholesterol in the body. mutations in the pcca or pccb gene disrupt the function of the enzyme and prevent the normal breakdown of these molecules. as a result, a substance called propionyl-coa and other potentially harmful compounds can build up to toxic levels in the body. this buildup damages the brain and nervous system, causing the serious health problems associated with propionic acidemia."
what is (are) achondroplasia and severe combined immunodeficiency ?,"achondroplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency is an extremely rare type of scid. the condition is characterized by the classic signs of scid, including severe and recurrent infections, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and absence of t and b lymphocytes along with skeletal anomalies like short stature, bowing of the long bones and other abnormalities affecting the ends of the long bones (metaphyseal abnormalities). children with this condition have a shortened life expectancy, generally surviving only into early childhood. achondroplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
what are the genetic changes related to coffin-siris syndrome ?,"coffin-siris syndrome is caused by mutations in the arid1a, arid1b, smarca4, smarcb1, or smarce1 gene. each of these genes provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of several different swi/snf protein complexes. swi/snf complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. chromatin is the network of dna and protein that packages dna into chromosomes. the structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly regions of dna are packaged. chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when dna is tightly packed, gene expression is often lower than when dna is loosely packed.  through their ability to regulate gene activity, swi/snf complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged dna; copying (replicating) dna; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells.  although it is unclear what effect mutations in these genes have on swi/snf complexes, researchers suggest that the mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of coffin-siris syndrome."
what is (are) histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome ?,"histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is a group of conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. this group of disorders includes h syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (phid), faisalabad histiocytosis, and familial rosai-dorfman disease (also known as familial sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy or fshml). these conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders; however, because of the overlapping features and shared genetic cause, they are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum. while some affected individuals have signs and symptoms characteristic of one of these conditions, others have a range of features from two or more of the conditions. the pattern of signs and symptoms can vary, even within the same family. all of the conditions in the spectrum are characterized by histiocytosis, which is an overgrowth of immune system cells called histiocytes. these cells abnormally accumulate in one or more tissues in the body, which can lead to organ or tissue damage. the lymph nodes are commonly affected, leading to swelling of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). other areas of cell accumulation can include skin, kidneys, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), or digestive tract. the spectrum is known as histiocytosis-lymphadenoapthy plus syndrome because the disorders that make up the spectrum can have additional signs and symptoms. h syndrome is named for the collection of symptoms - all starting with the letter h - that are commonly present. these include hyperpigmented skin lesions with excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) and histiocyte accumulation, enlargement of the liver or liver and spleen (hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly), heart abnormalities, hearing loss, reduced amounts of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadism), and short stature (reduced height). in some cases, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus may also be present. phid is characterized by patches of hyperpigmented skin with hypertrichosis and the development of type 1 diabetes during childhood. faisalabad histiocytosis is characterized by lymphadenopathy and swelling of the eyelids due to the accumulation of histiocytes. affected individuals may also have joint deformities (contractures) in their fingers or toes, and hearing loss. familial rosai-dorfman disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy, most often in the neck. histiocytes can also accumulate in other parts of the body. histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is caused by mutations in the slc29a3 gene. the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. treatment is aimed at treating the symptoms present in each individual."

what is (are) juvenile osteoporosis ?,"juvenile osteoporosis is a condition of bone demineralization characterized by pain in the back and extremities, multiple fractures, difficulty walking, and evidence of osteoporosis. symptoms typically develop just before puberty. osteoporosis is rare in children and adolescents. when it does occur, it is usually caused by an underlying medical disorder or by medications used to treat the disorder. this is called secondary osteoporosis. sometimes, however, there is no identifiable cause of osteoporosis in a child. this is known as idiopathic osteoporosis. there is no established medical or surgical therapy for juvenile osteoporosis. in some cases, treatment is not necessary, as the condition resolves spontaneously. early diagnosis may allow for preventive steps, including physical therapy, avoidance of weight-bearing activities, use of crutches and other supportive care. a well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin d is also important. in severe, long-lasting cases, medications such as bisphosphonates may be used. in most cases, complete recovery of bone occurs."
what are the symptoms of urinary tract infections in children ?,"symptoms of a uti range from slight burning with urination or unusual-smelling urine to severe pain and high fever. a child with a uti may also have no symptoms. a uti causes irritation of the lining of the bladder, urethra, ureters, and kidneys, just as the inside of the nose or the throat becomes irritated with a cold. in infants or children who are only a few years old, the signs of a uti may not be clear because children that young cannot express exactly how they feel. children may have a high fever, be irritable, or not eat.
                
on the other hand, children may have only a low-grade fever; experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; or just not seem healthy. children who have a high fever and appear sick for more than a day without signs of a runny nose or other obvious cause for discomfort should be checked for a uti.
                
older children with utis may complain of pain in the middle and lower abdomen. they may urinate often. crying or complaining that it hurts to urinate and producing only a few drops of urine at a time are other signs of a uti. children may leak urine into clothing or bedsheets. the urine may look cloudy or bloody. if a kidney is infected, children may complain of pain in the back or side below the ribs.
                
parents should talk with their health care provider if they suspect their child has a uti."
what is (are) atrial fibrillation ?,"atrial fibrillation (a-tre-al fi-bri-la-shun), or af, is the most common type of arrhythmia (ah-rith-me-ah). an arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. during an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.
                
af occurs if rapid, disorganized electrical signals cause the heart's two upper chamberscalled the atria (ay-tree-uh)to fibrillate. the term ""fibrillate"" means to contract very fast and irregularly.
                
in af, blood pools in the atria. it isn't pumped completely into the heart's two lower chambers, called the ventricles (ven-trih-kuls). as a result, the heart's upper and lower chambers don't work together as they should.
                
people who have af may not feel symptoms. however, even when af isn't noticed, it can increase the risk of stroke. in some people, af can cause chest pain or heart failure, especially if the heart rhythm is very rapid.
                
af may happen rarely or every now and then, or it may become an ongoing or long-term heart problem that lasts for years.
                
understanding the heart's electrical system
                
to understand af, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. the heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.
                
with each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. as the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.
                
each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (sa) node. the sa node is located in the right atrium. in a healthy adult heart at rest, the sa node sends an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute. (this rate may be slower in very fit athletes.)
                
from the sa node, the electrical signal travels through the right and left atria. it causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles.
                
the electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (av) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. here, the signal slows down slightly, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.
                
the electrical signal then leaves the av node and travels to the ventricles. it causes the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. the ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the sa node.
                
for more information about the heart's electrical system and detailed animations, go to the diseases and conditions index how the heart works article.
                
understanding the electrical problem in atrial fibrillation
                
in af, the heart's electrical signals don't begin in the sa node. instead, they begin in another part of the atria or in the nearby pulmonary veins. the signals don't travel normally. they may spread throughout the atria in a rapid, disorganized way. this can cause the atria to fibrillate.
                
the faulty signals flood the av node with electrical impulses. as a result, the ventricles also begin to beat very fast. however, the av node can't send the signals to the ventricles as fast as they arrive. so, even though the ventricles are beating faster than normal, they aren't beating as fast as the atria.
                
thus, the atria and ventricles no longer beat in a coordinated way. this creates a fast and irregular heart rhythm. in af, the ventricles may beat 100 to 175 times a minute, in contrast to the normal rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.
                
if this happens, blood isn't pumped into the ventricles as well as it should be. also, the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles to the body is based on the random atrial beats.
                
the body may get rapid, small amounts of blood and occasional larger amounts of blood. the amount will depend on how much blood has flowed from the atria to the ventricles with each beat.
                
most of the symptoms of af are related to how fast the heart is beating. if medicines or age slow the heart rate, the symptoms are minimized.
                
af may be brief, with symptoms that come and go and end on their own. or, the condition may be ongoing and require treatment. sometimes af is permanent, and medicines or other treatments can't restore a normal heart rhythm.

the animation shows how the heart's electrical signal can begin somewhere other than the sinoatrial node. this causes the atria to beat very fast and irregularly.
                
outlook
                
people who have af can live normal, active lives. for some people, treatment can restore normal heart rhythms.
                
for people who have permanent af, treatment can help control symptoms and prevent complications. treatment may include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes."

what are the genetic changes related to mandibuloacral dysplasia ?,"the two forms of mandibuloacral dysplasia are caused by mutations in different genes. mutations in the lmna gene cause mada, and mutations in the zmpste24 gene cause madb. within cells, these genes are involved in maintaining the structure of the nucleus and may play a role in many cellular processes.  the lmna gene provides instructions for making two related proteins, lamin a and lamin c. these proteins act as scaffolding (supporting) components of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus in cells. the nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus and may help regulate the activity of certain genes. mutations in this gene likely change the structure of lamin a and lamin c.  the lamin a protein (but not lamin c) must be processed within the cell before becoming part of the nuclear envelope. the protein produced from the zmpste24 gene is involved in this processing; it cuts the immature lamin a protein (prelamin a) at a particular location, forming mature lamin a. mutations in the zmpste24 gene lead to a buildup of prelamin a and a shortage of the mature protein.  mutations in the lmna or zmpste24 gene likely disrupt the structure of the nuclear envelope. researchers are working to understand how these genetic changes result in the signs and symptoms of mandibuloacral dysplasia."

who is at risk for parasites - scabies? ?,"transmission
    
human scabies is caused by an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). the adult female scabies mites burrow into the upper layer of the skin (epidermis) where they live and deposit their eggs. the microscopic scabies mite almost always is passed by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person who already is infested. an infested person can spread scabies even if he or she has no symptoms. humans are the source of infestation; animals do not spread human scabies.
    persons at risk
    
scabies can be passed easily by an infested person to his or her household members and sexual partners. scabies in adults frequently is sexually acquired.
    
scabies is a common condition found worldwide; it affects people of all races and social classes. scabies can spread easily under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is common. institutions such as nursing homes, extended-care facilities, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks. child care facilities also are a common site of scabies infestations.
    crusted (norwegian) scabies
    
some immunocompromised, elderly, disabled, or debilitated persons are at risk for a severe form of scabies called crusted, or norwegian, scabies. persons with crusted scabies have thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. the mites in crusted scabies are not more virulent than in non-crusted scabies; however, they are much more numerous (up to 2 million per patient). because they are infested with such large numbers of mites, persons with crusted scabies are very contagious to other persons. in addition to spreading scabies through brief direct skin-to-skin contact, persons with crusted scabies can transmit scabies indirectly by shedding mites that contaminate items such as their clothing, bedding, and furniture. persons with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent outbreaks of scabies."

what is (are) coronary heart disease ?,"espaol
                
coronary heart disease (chd) is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. these arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.
                
when plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. the buildup of plaque occurs over many years.
                
atherosclerosis
                

                
over time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
                
if the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface. a large blood clot can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. over time, ruptured plaque also hardens and narrows the coronary arteries.
                
overview
                
if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina or a heart attack can occur.
                
angina is chest pain or discomfort. it may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. the pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. angina pain may even feel like indigestion.
                
a heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. if blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious health problems or death.
                
over time, chd can weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure and arrhythmias. heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.
                
outlook
                
lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat coronary heart disease. these treatments may reduce the risk of related health problems."

is buschke ollendorff syndrome inherited ?,"how is buschke ollendorff syndrome inherited? buschke ollendorff syndrome (bos) is caused by mutations in the lemd3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that only one changed (mutated) copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient for a person to be affected by the condition. an affected individual may have inherited a mutated copy of the lemd3 gene from an affected parent, or they may have been born with a new (de novo) mutation. there is a 50% (1 in 2) chance for each child of an affected individual to inherit the mutated gene, and a 50% chance for each child  to not inherit the mutated gene. it has been proposed that the inheritance of bos shows incomplete penetrance. penetrance refers to the proportion of people with a particular genetic change (such as a mutation in a specific gene) who exhibit signs and symptoms of a genetic disorder. if some people with the mutation do not develop features of the disorder, the condition is said to have reduced (or incomplete) penetrance. reduced penetrance probably results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, many of which are unknown. this phenomenon can make it challenging for genetics professionals to interpret a persons family medical history and predict the risk of passing a genetic condition to future generations. this means that not all individuals who have a new or inherited mutation in the lemd3 gene will necessarily develop signs and symptoms of bos."

what causes urinary incontinence in children ?,"the exact cause of most cases of nighttime ui is not known. though a few cases are caused by structural problems in the urinary tract, most cases probably result from a mix of factors including slower physical development, an overproduction of urine at night, and the inability to recognize bladder filling when asleep. nighttime ui has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), osa, and anxiety. children also may inherit genes from one or both parents that make them more likely to have nighttime ui.
                
slower physical development
                
between the ages of 5 and 10, bedwetting may be the result of a small bladder capacity, long sleeping periods, and underdevelopment of the bodys alarms that signal a full or emptying bladder. this form of ui fades away as the bladder grows and the natural alarms become operational.
                
overproduction of urine at night
                
the body produces antidiuretic hormone (adh), a natural chemical that slows down the production of urine. more adh is produced at night so the need to urinate lessens. if the body does not produce enough adh at night, the production of urine may not slow down, leading to bladder overfilling. if a child does not sense the bladder filling and awaken to urinate, wetting will occur.
                
structural problems
                
a small number of ui cases are caused by physical problems in the urinary tract. rarely, a blocked bladder or urethra may cause the bladder to overfill and leak. nerve damage associated with the birth defect spina bifida can cause ui. in these cases, ui can appear as a constant dribbling of urine.
                
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
                
children with adhd are three times more likely to have nighttime ui than children without adhd.2 the connection between adhd and bedwetting has not been explained, but some experts theorize that both conditions are related to delays in central nervous system development.
                
obstructive sleep apnea
                
nighttime ui may be one sign of osa. other symptoms of osa include snoring, mouth breathing, frequent ear and sinus infections, sore throat, choking, and daytime drowsiness. experts believe that when the airway in people with osa closes, a chemical may be released in the body that increases water production and inhibits the systems that regulate fluid volume. successful treatment of osa often resolves the associated nighttime ui.
                
anxiety
                
anxiety-causing events that occur between 2 and 4 years of agebefore total bladder control is achievedmight lead to primary enuresis. anxiety experienced after age 4 might lead to secondary enuresis in children who have been dry for at least 6 months. events that cause anxiety in children include physical or sexual abuse; unfamiliar social situations, such as moving or starting at a new school; and major family events such as the birth of a sibling, a death, or divorce.
                
ui itself is an anxiety-causing event. strong bladder contractions resulting in daytime leakage can cause embarrassment and anxiety that lead to nighttime wetting.
                
genetics
                
certain genes have been found to contribute to ui. children have a 30 percent chance of having nighttime ui if one parent was affected as a child. if both parents were affected, there is a 70 percent chance of bedwetting.1"

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with gallbladder cancer.
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with gallbladder cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used:
                    surgery    gallbladder cancer may be treated with a cholecystectomy, surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissues around it. nearby lymph nodes may be removed. a laparoscope is sometimes used to guide gallbladder surgery. the laparoscope is attached to a video camera and inserted through an incision (port) in the abdomen. surgical instruments are inserted through other ports to perform the surgery. because there is a risk that gallbladder cancer cells may spread to these ports, tissue surrounding the port sites may also be removed.    if the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may relieve symptoms:            - surgical biliary bypass: if the tumor is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. during this operation, the gallbladder or bile duct will be cut and sewn to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area.      -  endoscopic stent placement: if the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin, flexible tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. the stent may be placed through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine.      -  percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: a procedure done to drain bile when there is a blockage and endoscopic stent placement is not possible. an x-ray of the liver and bile ducts is done to locate the blockage. images made by ultrasound are used to guide placement of a stent, which is left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. this procedure may be done to relieve jaundice before surgery.              radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy:            -  external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat gallbladder cancer.       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website.     radiation sensitizers    clinical trials are studying ways to improve the effect of radiation therapy on tumor cells, including the following:            -  hyperthermia therapy: a treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy and certain anticancer drugs.     -  radiosensitizers: drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. giving radiation therapy together with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    follow-up tests may be needed.
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

what is (are) denys-drash syndrome ?,"denys-drash syndrome is a condition that affects the kidneys and genitalia.  denys-drash syndrome is characterized by kidney disease that begins within the first few months of life. affected individuals have a condition called diffuse glomerulosclerosis, in which scar tissue forms throughout glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from blood. in people with denys-drash syndrome, this condition often leads to kidney failure in childhood. people with denys-drash syndrome have an estimated 90 percent chance of developing a rare form of kidney cancer known as wilms tumor. affected individuals may develop multiple tumors in one or both kidneys.  although males with denys-drash syndrome have the typical male chromosome pattern (46,xy), they have gonadal dysgenesis, in which external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia) or the genitalia appear completely female. the testes of affected males are undescended, which means they are abnormally located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. as a result, males with denys-drash are typically unable to have biological children (infertile).  affected females usually have normal genitalia and have only the kidney features of the condition. because they do not have all the features of the condition, females are usually given the diagnosis of isolated nephrotic syndrome."

what causes hereditary fructose intolerance ?,"what causes hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi)? hfi is caused by alterations (mutations) in the aldob gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldolase b. this enzyme is primarily found in the liver and is involved in the breakdown of fructose into energy. mutations in the aldob gene reduce the function of the enzyme, impairing its ability to metabolize fructose. this causes a toxic buildup of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells, which results in the death of liver cells over time."
what are the treatments for anemia in chronic kidney disease ?,"depending on the cause, a health care provider treats anemia with one or more of the following treatments:
                
iron
                
the first step in treating anemia is raising low iron levels. iron pills may help improve iron and hemoglobin levels. however, for patients on hemodialysis, many studies show pills do not work as well as iron given intravenously.2
                
erythropoietin
                
if blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia, treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of epo. a health care provider, often a nurse, injects the patient with epo subcutaneously, or under the skin, as needed. some patients learn how to inject the epo themselves. patients on hemodialysis may receive epo intravenously during hemodialysis.
                
studies have shown the use of epo increases the chance of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with ckd. the health care provider will carefully review the medical history of the patient and determine if epo is the best treatment for the patients anemia. experts recommend using the lowest dose of epo that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. additionally, health care providers should consider the use of epo only when a patients hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dl. health care providers should not use epo to maintain a patients hemoglobin level above 11.5 g/dl.2 patients who receive epo should have regular blood tests to monitor their hemoglobin so the health care provider can adjust the epo dose when the level is too high or too low.2 health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of epo with their patients.
                
many people with kidney disease need iron supplements and epo to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. in some people, iron supplements and epo will improve the symptoms of anemia.
                
red blood cell transfusions
                
if a patients hemoglobin falls too low, a health care provider may prescribe a red blood cell transfusion. transfusing red blood cells into the patients vein raises the percentage of the patients blood that consists of red blood cells, increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body.
                
vitamin b12 and folic acid supplements
                
a health care provider may suggest vitamin b12 and folic acid supplements for some people with ckd and anemia. using vitamin supplements can treat low levels of vitamin b12 or folic acid and help treat anemia. to help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements, with their health care provider.

what is (are) tumors and pregnancy ?,"tumors during pregnancy are rare, but they can happen. tumors can be either benign or malignant. benign tumors aren't cancer. malignant ones are. the most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer, cervical cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma. cancer itself rarely harms the baby, and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy. you and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment. your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is, as well as the type, size, and stage of your cancer.    another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (gtd). it happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus. gtd is not always easy to find. it is usually benign, but some types can be malignant. the most common type of gtd is a molar pregnancy. in its early stages, it may look like a normal pregnancy. you should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding).     treatment depends on the type of tumor, whether it has spread to other places, and your overall health."
